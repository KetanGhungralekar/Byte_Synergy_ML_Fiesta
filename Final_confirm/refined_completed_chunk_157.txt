15 years is the typical timeframe for cultivating trees, with variations cited from 10 to 15 years based on factors such as tree type and maintenance practices. The yield range over these periods can vary significantly: within 10 years, one might expect between 5-3 kilograms of rice whereas in 15 years, yields could be between 10-20 kilograms or even more depending on conditions. The suitability of the planted species is not limited to red soil; it can thrive across various soil types including red loam which supports a higher oil content and is favorable for white ants. Security measures are crucial given that unauthorized individuals cannot tend to the plantation without proper oversight—fencing and other protective measures may be necessary. On a larger scale (200â"300 feet), an optimal planting density of around 4 stampas (approx.
69 acres) has been found effective by some farmers who have expanded their operations beyond traditional norms up to approximately double that area while still achieving profitable outcomes through agroforestry practices like intercropping soap nuts for several years, which provide additional income beyond the main crop cycle when mature trees start producing seeds after about a decade at market rates of roughly Rs.

In addition to monetary benefits, community involvement such as regular annual plantations as part of activities like blood donation camps contributes to biodiversity by fostering different age stages of plants in agricultural landscapes yearly replenishment programs are essential projects managed collectively by local communities help ensure sustainable growth and resilience against environmental variabilities Current efforts include maintaining diverse ages ranging from four upwards across multiple species within gardens sustainably without relying solely on single plantation events A notable mention among crops is silver oaks which offer further economic potential alongside traditional fruit trees or nut crops
