The passage discusses a sustainable approach to afforestation that prioritizes natural growth over cultivated methods. It highlights the importance of selecting suitable host trees, especially Nimbus and Mosambi, which are resilient hosts for various plants. The process involves planting roots directly without using wood, and it prohibits open grazing within 3-4 years if the vegetation exceeds 5-6 feet in height due to potential overgrazing by farmers' animals. Permission for tree planting can be obtained from the forest department at a cost of 3 rupees per acre; they also provide seedlings. The text emphasizes avoiding nurseries and instead sourcing seeds from natural forests and relying on agricultural techniques like intercropping with white ants, which can help save up to 500 out of 1000 planted trees after fifteen years. Monetary gains should not be the sole focus; rather than worrying about profits or deposits in banks, individuals should concentrate on growing trees as part of their lifestyle contribution to environmental conservation. Trustworthy local government nurseries like those in Chintamani near Srinivasapura, Kolar have been recognized by forest departments for their efforts in this regard, offering guidance and permission for aspiring planters who seek it locally. This approach aims to benefit everyone through widespread awareness and participation in afforestation initiatives.
