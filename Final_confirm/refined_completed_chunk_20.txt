Devarajra Devi has initiated a project to establish a new forest in the district and enlisted the support of local residents, including the narrator, who are eager to assist her. The initiative aims not only to create a forest but also to provide housing for farmers, which is seen as integral to supporting both the environment and future generations. Upon visiting Kurubareli in Chitradurga district, the narrator was struck by the beauty of the area and met Raju and Timopar, who have significantly impacted these lands by raising over 25,000 children in their care. These individuals are also dedicated bird feeders because they believe every creature deserves nourishment; hearing birdsong reminds them of being amidst nature's bounty.
The village has taken an impressive effort by relocating thousands of birds from populations exceeding one lakh (100,00) into open fields within an eight-year period. The narrative emphasizes that while figures like Kota Deshwar or Srikantabhildi often lead agricultural initiatives at scale across various states like Maharashtra or Telangana respectively., significant contributions have been made locally too—most notably by Srikantabhildi in Chitradurga district—despite facing challenges with government policies that initially required obtaining permissions even from top officials at institutions such as Mysore Sandalwood factory before proceeding with plans for expanding sandalwood cultivation into open markets.
