The paragraph discusses an issue related to the illegal harvesting of plants, specifically mahogany trees, from a farm where 50 out of 1000 plants are illegally cut down annually. This amounts to the loss of ₹50 lakh (five million rupees) per year for the farmer. The constant repetition emphasizes that if one tree is worth ₹50 lakh when captured, it's not merely about farming but has implications for sustainability and environmental conservation. Raising awareness about deforestation and its consequences, particularly in terms of biodiversity loss and potential conversion of agricultural land into gold mines, the author stresses that these actions undermine social responsibilities towards wildlife habitats and environmental stewardship. Encouraging responsible practices like maintaining a distance of at least 50 feet between animals to protect vegetation from being cut down by mistake or due to demand from 'workers,' including those who might lead operations like logging or mining on protected lands such as forests, is part of preserving natural resources and preventing unethical exploitation.
