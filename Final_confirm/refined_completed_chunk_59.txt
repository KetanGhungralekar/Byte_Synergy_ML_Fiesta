In Karnataka, the cultivation of Srikandha—a vital yet challenging plant—is a concern for farmers who rely on its parasitic nature to sustain growth. Despite efforts across various crops like pears, mangoes, apples, betel nuts, watermelons, unisean (likely a typo for okra or another vegetable), curry leaves, lime fruits, and mace (possible reference to nutmeg), along with conventional farming practices since 9 years without significant yield increase from Srikandha due to its complexities. The average age of those engaged in Srikandha farming is between 18-25 years old with aspirations similar to salaried professionals expecting regular income and retirement benefits.
The agricultural system proposed integrates agriculture with horticulture and agroforestry alongside animal husbandry as four complementary components aiming to mitigate the challenges associated with monoculture dependency on plants like Srikandha which command uncertain market rates and future prospects. The locality Beri is identified as an ideal area for mass propagation of these plants if paired appropriately with suitable hosts that support their growth. Through comprehensive research over nine years focused solely on sustaining this crop under diverse conditions it has been realized that achieving financial stability through traditional means alone may not be feasible; hence diversification is key .Currently there are no documented case studies or images available comparing different approaches towards optimizing yields from Vala Mani farms but ongoing trials continue exploring viable solutions by engaging directly with farmers who have experienced varying degrees of success despite difficult circumstances.
