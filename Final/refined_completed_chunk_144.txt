Bisl Nand in India is renowned for growing 'Natural red' variety of Sindhu tomatoes, which are highly regarded in both the pharmaceutical and food industries. These tomatoes thrive well in small farms or market gardens due to their adaptability. They command a high price in markets, reflecting their quality. Local farmers have expressed a desire to cultivate these crops independently, concerned about the difficulties of large-scale production without adequate agricultural education and infrastructure support. A proposal suggests that farmers could establish their own markets rather than relying on established chains like Reliance Fresh. The Sindhu tomato is rich in vitamin C and has therapeutic uses; it's also known as starfruit when ripened completely. The starfruit plant itself is perennial and does not require chemicals for growth; it produces sweet fruits with no leaves present at harvest time (the stems serve as the fruit bearing structure). Additionally, Bisl Nand grows numerous other tropical fruits such as candied fruits (possibly tamarindo), lemons including Thai limes, golden citaphal oranges, among others. These fruits are air-layered hybrids developed without chemical interventions, contributing to sustainable farming practices that ensure good fragrance while providing nutritious produce directly benefiting local communities by reducing dependency on external healthcare resources through healthy diets provided by these natural foods grown right within villages where children can enjoy them safely under the supervision of resident farmers who value these traditional methods passed down through generations
