The speaker emphasizes the importance of hard work to develop leadership skills, warning that laziness leads to living as a slave. Addressing daughters who embody leadership qualities, he encourages them to remain active, stating their actions reflect on their households. He shares his personal routine—rising before 5 am for an event where he's foregoing sleep—and advocates for learning through hands-on experience in agriculture despite its novelty and lack of precedent.

He recounts starting with zero agricultural knowledge but facing multiple challenges: extreme temperatures while visiting the desert thrice, poor soil conditions without prior cultivation history, and various crop-related issues such as harvest difficulties. Despite these hurdles, he persisted and innovated by planting pomegranate trees amidst horticultural crops; this gamble paid off initially with yield prices ranging from INR 143 to INR 180 per kg for high-quality produce until they were afflicted by Bacterial Blight disease (Dundana Vangamari). This caused him significant financial losses which reached up to an advanced payment of INR 5 lakhs prior to outbreaks like Balashta and Dalambari diseases that further threatened his investment. The situation was exacerbated by external factors including the Chennai floods sealing dams which prevented irrigation during critical periods, ultimately leading him not onlyto lose most of his investments amounting upwards of INR 75 lakhs but also affecting farmers severely impacted by Dundana Vangamari disease who looked towards compensatory measures post disaster recovery efforts necessitated due unforeseen events beyond his control at dawn when attempting to carry essential items like bags with him.
