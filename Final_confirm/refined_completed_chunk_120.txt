Australian sandalwood trees are highly valuable, with significant potential for profit in agricultural endeavors. Recognizing this, farmers have begun cultivating these trees despite past government restrictions on private planting. Currently, the Indian government promotes the propagation of sandalwood trees and allows private ownership of saplings. However, all aspects of production remain under state control until the tree is registered after approximately 15 years when it matures enough to yield profitable quantities of heartwood. The average weight of heartwood from a mature 2-foot tree is around 70-80 kg, which is quite dense due to its high oil content; for instance, an astounding 1 kg oil fetches upwards of INR 5 lakhs (500 thousand rupees), making half a gram worth approximately INR 2500 and one gram close to INR 5000 on the market. While initial investments include maintaining young plants for about two years before they become established (resistant to pests like fungi) without additional support such as hosting plants or nutrient supplements, long-term care over a decade can lead to substantial wealth generationâ€”potentially transforming growers into millionaires with financial security guaranteed by consistent yields post establishment period.
