 The Karnataka government produces Sri Gandha Sandalwood oil, a high-quality product with significant market value. Retail options include 5g and 10g packs for individual purchase, while larger quantities of 100g and up to 1kg are also available at increasing prices; specifically, 10g costs INR 5,000 (about USD 64), with corresponding pricing for larger sizes leading to a per kilogram cost of INR 5 lakhs (INR 5 million or about USD 64,387). Despite the high value of sandalwood oil production by the government at this rate, there are logistical challenges due to its weight that must be managed in projects. A SWOT analysis is recommended to evaluate these aspects: strengths such as the quality and rarity of the product; weaknesses like handling difficulties; opportunities presented by public demand and global markets; and challenges which stem from maintaining security given its substantial valueâ€”especially when compared to threats that could arise if proper measures aren't taken.
In terms of infrastructure associated with sandalwood products like Sri Gandha, they often reside within government facilities where access is restricted since it's not private property but state owned. However, technological advancements have led to innovations such as linking an individual's Aadhar number through biometrics if surveillance cameras capture their identification data accurately. This suggests an integration of modern tech solutions in managing precious resources effectively within our increasingly interconnected globalized economy. The overarching theme emphasizes balance between leveraging technology for growth while acknowledging risks versus rewards inherent in any venture involving valuable commodities like Sandalwood oil extracted under strict state supervision even before one reaches adulthood or able consciousness according to local wisdom traditions suggesting foresight can lead prosperity both personally and collectively among communities involved in agricultural practices including sandalwood farming which offers potential returns on investment when managed wisely amidst carefully assessed risks tailoredto market dynamics globally..
