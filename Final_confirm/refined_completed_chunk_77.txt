In the given paragraph, it is emphasized that laborers working with 10 kg of product earn 5,000 rupees, equating to a value of 1,000,000 ruapees per kg. The minimum wage per kg of grain is set at 398 rupees (3 Thalimba). Workers contribute significantly over 12-15 years and are entitled to a 'retirement' or benefit package after such service. This system has been passed down through generations – parents and grandparents have also worked for similar periods to receive their benefits. The speaker explains that despite performing various duties like thalimba (grazing cattle), mosaum (churning butter), maavu (curd preparation), ullakkadi (toddy tapping), batha (firewood collection) and kabbu crops harvesting - they never received these due rewards until now.

The speech then shifts focus on Shri Gandha as an individual who has made significant contributions but never before received recognition or land rights in return. It suggests that by engaging in legitimate agricultural practices under Sreegandha Kalumadana Trust rather than illegal activities like smuggling or consuming banned substances, one can gain fame and potential land rights while serving nature positively without harm.

Veerappan is cited as being famous posthumously because he stood up against oppressive systems; similarly, the trust aims to empower individuals to achieve strength for social revolutions within regions like Karnataka ("Gandhada"), NADU ("Chinnada"), Bidar district ("Bidu"). The trust claims to be different from corporate entities because its foundation rests upon agriculture and farming principles rather than commercial interests. Emphasizing personal transformation and national pride analogous to India's struggle for independence from British rule, the speaker invokes historical figures like Bhagat Singh to inspire action towards societal change within oneself first before confronting broader issues nationally. Lastly, the success story shared involves trees planted by Sreegandha Kalumadana Trust reaching maturity at ages younger than typically expected due to favorable conditions provided by quality land—analogous perhapsto how India can rise premium above other nations through collective effort driven by individuals willingto invest time into cultivating positive changes in society ('your country is like Sreegandha').
