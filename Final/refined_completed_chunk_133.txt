 The government promotes various schemes aimed at supporting agricultural development, particularly in areas where high-value crops like agarwood can yield substantial revenues; 1 kilogram of agarwood is worth approximately 16 lakh Indian rupees, potentially reaching up to 2-3 crores when processed into oil. There's a concerning rise in youth suicides, which emphasizes the need for alternative income sources and lifestyle changes. Suresh Babantha manages a Greenwood farm in Kolaru, Karnataka, located 68 kilometers from Bangalore. This multifaceted farm practices sustainable agriculture by integrating poultry, aquaculture, horticulture (including vegetable farming), kitchen gardening with herbs and medicinal plants along with agricultural tourism initiatives. The farm offers regular weekly training sessions for local farmers to ensure they understand and apply at least half of the techniques practiced on the farm â€“ these are taught through direct instruction rather than video or projector presentations. A notable aspect of this program is its appeal to youth who may have abandoned traditional farming due to minimal returns but now have an opportunity to engage with modern agricultural methods that promise better financial stability after dedicating just ten years back into it full time - offering them hope without having left behind their family properties or educational qualifications such as SLC/PUC degrees obtained while working part-time priorly engaged in urban settings like Bengaluru for similar roles over past decades .
