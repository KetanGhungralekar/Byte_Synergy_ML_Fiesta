As an RTC (Research and Training Center) entry-level professional, I have been involved in the process of tree cultivation and classification. After filing a case for tree harvesting approval, the procedure involves loading harvested wood with appropriate moisture content onto a vehicle provided by the RTC. Upon arrival at the processing site, each log is given a preliminary categorization based on quality standards after being dressed (shaped). Farmers are currently contending with an existing classification system designed for forest-grown trees, which does not align with their needs. To address this issue, an association of farmers met with a minister last year to discuss creating new classifications—stem/root/sap/dust/bark—with individual rates that better suit farmed trees. For instance, if purchasing trees under Class 1 averages Rs.6000 per unit nationally but only Rs.12000 for forest-grown ones locally due to transportation costs and other factors affecting market prices), our objective is to develop more accurate categories reflective of local farming conditions.
The BMM organic farm visited demonstrates sustainable practices where sandalwood saplings are interplanted alongside host or nurse trees to facilitate growth without immediate transplanting; this method enhances survival rates as the young sandalwood trees benefit from proximity to mature hosts that provide shade and water until they can stand independently around three years later when fully established within their own space among variously aged sibling plants totaling 15 different varieties including Australian types commonly found across highly esteemed markets globally like India's Sandalwood Industry .
