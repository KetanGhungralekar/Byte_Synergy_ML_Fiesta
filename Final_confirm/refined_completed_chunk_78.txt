 The E-protection system is an advanced security framework designed for forestry protection that integrates a microchip in the center of operation, powered by sensors and devoid of physical wires. It connects to the ground through four gateways linked via routers, with one connection dedicated to the IWST server (Indian Wood Science Technology), which is associated with the Indian Wood Science Society responsible for tree research. The system employs both day vision and night vision cameras on drones provided within this setup. Day vision cameras identify individuals or animals during daylight hours, while darkvision captures images even at night and converts them into black and white for analysis by IWST, regardless of whether subjects are human or animal.
For every 100 units registered, users receive a personalized nameplate alerting when their limit approaches, triggering an instant notification either locally or remotely to nearby police stations if stolen goods are detected beyond this threshold. This intelligent monitoring service costs INR 2000 annually after initial payment but returns funding upon building completion; monthly maintenance fees are minimal at INR 100 per month with active support from Monday through Wednesday until late evening hours (24-27).
The implementation involves discussions about water usage in constructionâ€”the speaker advocates for reduced water costs rather than increased ones due to higher demand, emphasizing that adding unnecessary expense would only lead to having less available water without any gain. Scientifically or technically speaking,' increasing cost should not be justified as it does not serve the project's best interest sustainably over time. Ultimately, it aims to establish a long-term investment such that future generations can appreciate its value like planting a significant seed today for future growth and prosperity.
