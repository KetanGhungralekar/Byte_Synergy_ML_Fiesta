Manjanaath and Madhya are overseeing a project named Aso, where currently 17 individuals are involved. Food provision for this many people is necessary. Three individuals tasked with collection anticipate surpassing Aldem's output with numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6. The core issue revolves around Srikanth who initiated the Mysore sand factory despite stiff resistance from senior officials due to his relentless drive that mirrored efforts comparable to the Taipei market's scale without any oversight or commission payments.
