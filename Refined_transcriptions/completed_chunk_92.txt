NMPB is the name you can google. It is enough for 27 years. One time. Ten people are given. We have planted the Sashi. 300 people are planted. Then, if the good quality Sashi is found in the area, we take it there. Or, if it is found in private land, we take it there. I will take it and give it to you for 35 rupees. 300 people. How much did it cost? 10,000. How much did the government pay? 22,000. 22,000. Then, you will get the money. When you get the money, for 22,000, 12,000 rupees is enough to plant the Sashi.
