100 crores were realized from the sale of a particular property. The seller is aware that such transactions result in losses for farmers and acknowledges the necessity to proceed with sales, whether in the morning or evening. The financial outcome indicates potential profits exceeding one crore per day upon resale. The property comprises three types of houses: Raktachandana, White, and Shrikanth, with Raktachandana being considered an optimal investment due to its pricing and association with positivity via a connection to Minister Shrikanth who allocated 100 crores towards these properties.
The construction process involves creating supportive structures within the land parcels to be built on. A specific tree-support method using 10 feet of wood (with one and half feet mixed with mud and coconut) has been employed successfully without harming existing trees while allowing new growth after removing covers; this method also includes planting seeds alongside support structures when necessary. The use of government-supplied filter coconuts is part of their sustainable practices for enhancing soil quality before laying down full depth knots during construction where gaps are deliberately made for vegetation integration without compromising structural integrity, watered either naturally by rainfall or manually through irrigation systems when needed, including utilization of drip methods for efficient water usage.
