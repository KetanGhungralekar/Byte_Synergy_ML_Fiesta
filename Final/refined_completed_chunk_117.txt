The paragraph discusses the importance of aeration and soil health for maintaining plant vigor against pest attacks, specifically from borers. It highlights that human brains cannot survive without a constant supply of oxygen, drawing an analogy to plants. The text emphasizes the significance of organic fertilizers like nitrifycing trees over chemical alternatives to maintain soil fertility, preventing nutrient depletion which can lead to plant suffering if left barren for 3-4 years. Key data points mentioned include observing signs of a healthy coconut palm—50-100 grams visible from a meter or 50 cm distance—and noting its moisture level during heat stress conditions caused by soil warmth and lack of irrigation.
For confirming the presence and development of artificial roots (artificial root formation) in palms such as Srikandha, invasive yet non-destructive methods are recommended after 8 years; these involve using tools like electronic resistancescal domos or increment borers to detect minute electrical current movements within wood samples indicative of root growth internaly. The process is crucial for ensuring tree stability post-planting, with findings supporting their placement slightly below ground level to induce slight stress that may naturally encourage art root formation. Despite various studies suggesting ways to disturb soil around roots potentially stimulating art root growth, precise mechanisms remain unclear scientifically.
