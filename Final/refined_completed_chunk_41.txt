Muthu, a poor man who owns a Rathna tree, finds himself in a conversation with wealthy individuals who are urging him to sell his house and engage in business. However, Muthu is wary of the potential for financial exploitation by the rich and decides against selling his property. He believes that planting and nurturing the rare Rathna tree brings significant benefits, including improved air quality and healthâ€”benefits he feels others like Sanjeeva and Kesava overlook or undervalue despite their wealth. In a twist of fate, Muthu's son becomes severely ill from an unknown poisonous substance. Desperate for treatment options beyond conventional medicine, Muthu learns that extracts from his own Rathna tree can cure this specific type of poisoning. Given its rarity and value as a medicinal resource, obtaining more of the trees proves challenging due to their exclusive nature; however, Muthu remains committed to collecting them at great personal cost to save his son's life. Amidst these trials, there is an underlying tension regarding how each character values wealth versus natural resources and ultimately what lengths one must go through when faced with danger affecting loved ones.
