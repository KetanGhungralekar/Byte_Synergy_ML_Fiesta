In the midst of planning to plant five Dalimbas in a forest during the rainy season, their first four are already sprouting out of the pots. The team is impressed with the tranquility and beauty of this eco-friendly project, with each tree resembling an intricately carved piece of art. Over two months, these trees have grown significantly and now stand majestically. These are no ordinary trees; they are sandalwood varieties known for their fragrance and medicinal properties, valued at 18 months' growthâ€”a testament to sustainable cultivation practices.

The site holds historical significance as well, being used as a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna over 1300 years ago. Despite its rich history and magnificent characteristics, some individuals have criticized it due to its natural odor associated with sandalwood production. Nonetheless, efforts have been made to transform this place into a sanctuary for spiritual reflection where visitors can immerse themselves in nature while also paying homage at what was once a sacred shrine. With continuous care from "their doctor," these precious trees continue to flourish under human stewardship alongside ancient traditions that honor both divine grace and relentless dedication towards preserving natural heritage in Bengaluru's diverse landscapes.
