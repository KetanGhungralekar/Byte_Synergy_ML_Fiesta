Farmers in the forest of Arvind Lingdhali have innovatively adapted to grow crops using soap and detergent, which significantly reduces labor costs. With this method, they harvest between 30 to 48 tons annually over the past seven years. Labor requirements are minimal, with typically two to three workers needed for each crop cycle. These farmers previously faced challenges with traditional methods but have now successfully integrated modern techniques such as electric sickles and other power-driven tools for more efficient harvesters. The introduction of these tools has marked a significant improvement in productivity and is credited with being a transformative change brought about by an individual named Hasht who initiated demand for better practices at Acompa Bellavalli farms. This shift has led to increased yields without extensive capital investment or reliance on manual labor-intensive processes.
