 Born on May 8th, the speaker resides near their farm in Kuruveli village, Karnataka, and has observed an abundance of Srikandha trees throughout the region. They express a profound connection with nature, noting that while they can hear birds singing at a distance, they cannot perceive any sound when standing close to them amongst the trees. The area is rich in biodiversity and natural beauty; however, the speaker laments that humans haven't adequately cared for it due to their actions affecting environmental conservation efforts.
The farmland is extensively covered with Srikandha trees which have spread far beyond countable numbers. These trees originate from seeds dispersed by local birds present everywhereâ€”from neighboring farms to remote villages where these bird-grown seedlings are visible and cultivated further by farmers who view this as an ecologically sustainable practice contributing to land revival and water resource management within their district aiming to supply irrigation support through river diversion projects for agricultural purposes.

The message conveyed emphasizes positivity towards nature over negativity faced earlier from those who disregarded such eco-friendly practices. The speakers appeal holds three requests: firstly, sharing knowledge about how one can grow land organically even within residential premises; secondly, leveraging community power to transport river water directly into farmer's fields; thirdly extending support or joining hands with initiatives aimed at conserving the environment by nurturing native flora like Srikandha trees propagated via avian agencies
