The local practice involves collecting snow from the mountains each morning and transporting it directly to rivers, particularly from Sauri. This tradition has been ongoing for at least 3-4 years. The villagers have implemented a buyback system for the seeds harvested over KG quantities, with prices ranging between 500-500 rupees per unit. Dried seeds are preferred for this process, which is especially important during winter months.

Regarding spiritual beliefs, there's a focus on learning about the Lord and his connection to celestial events like blood moons; one such moon is believed to be approximately 80 feet in diameter compared to the Lord's size of 3,000 feet. The community takes great care in handling seeds responsiblyâ€”ensuring that both farmers and seed viability are preserved when transferring them after harvest or storage periods. Seeds are often booked by farmers in June and July with a cost of around 3 rupees each due to their high value; however, concerns about seed pricing being as high as 50 rupees persist among some individuals who believe government acquisition may offer better solutions without any issue identified thus far. Farmers utilize these seeds across various regions beyond their original location, contributing to agricultural diversity and food security locally known as 'the land of fragrance.'
