The forestry industry in Jogimatti Forest, Chitradurga, Kottayam, has seen growth due to increased efforts by authorities to prevent illegal activities such as timber offences. The protection of the environment by stopping these offences is a priority. Red sandalwood is highly valued globally; with India being one of its major sources from states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, including regions like Kadapa and Chittoor. In India, red sandalwood fetches a very high price point due to its exceptional quality; it's particularly sought after in countries like China and Japan where it commands an even higher value. Illicit smuggling networks sell Indian red sandalwood at rates ranging from 2 to 3 crore rupees per ton.
In addition to highlighting the environmental conservation efforts and the illegal trade dynamics of red sandalwood, local farmers are praised for their dedication through initiatives led by individuals like Yashogathe within regions such as Sri Gandhada Nadu in Karnataka. Notably, Gopalakrishna from Bailusime village near Kolarathaluku has successfully cultivated his farm on 12 acres in this region recently promoted by both state farmers and government encouragement. This exemplifies transitioning practices towards sustainable agriculture while honoring traditional farming methods that can serve as inspiration for others across diverse geographical areas within the state's various districts
