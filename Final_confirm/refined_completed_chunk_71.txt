The preparation of holy water for treating skin diseases has significant health benefits, reducing various ailments through its application in daily practices. A 4.5-year-old sun root tree with a girth of approximately 40 cm was tested for hot wood formation using an increment borer. Vinay successfully extracted a core sample from the tree and detected early signs of hot wood conversion, indicating successful transformation in this young tree despite it being light initially. To seal the borehole, a stick was inserted, which will autoignite within three months without causing any adverse effects on the tree's development. An upcoming comprehensive video on Blackwood (Sun Root) will address common questions about its cultivation and assemble resources to understand how soil erosion over three years due to human activity has impacted local farmers' land, with specific mention of sand loss up to one foot depth around the trees. The narrative emphasizes natural processes leading to changes seen in trees and ecosystems over time, including monitoring wildlife such as rabbits that are part of these environments.'
