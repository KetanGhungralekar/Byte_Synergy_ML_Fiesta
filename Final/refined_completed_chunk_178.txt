The current legal framework allows for the direct sale of agricultural produce to private entities, which will become more prominent in the next 2-3 years due to an upcoming change in law. A farmer with a personal landholding of 100 acres and affiliations with the Ramesh Balutti family's 5,000-acre farm is involved in procuring raw materials for processing. The Ramesh Balutti family's annual requirement of raw materials amounts to INR 5,00 - 15,00 crores. Mouliyore Dhani Malik oversees this procurement and processing; however, the lack of infrastructure prevents farmers like him from directly producing products branded under Mouliyore Dhani. Instead, larger companies such as Mekin India facilitate these processes by creating markets and employment opportunities locally within Indore region where Mouliyore Dhani products are manufactured.
To address this issue, the farmer has registered his company under Gandha Medicinal and Aromatic Company but currently relies on purchasing oils from others for soapmaking and cosmetic production. He requests government intervention to liberalize markets so that they can utilize medical bills as leverage for transformative changes regarding property rights without needing explicit permission from KSDL (Karnataka State Diaries Liquor Ltd.) or R&A (Regional Accounts). The proposed solution includes drafting an MOU with KSDL followed by document submission and verification by R&A leading up to product ratings before manufacturingâ€”with payments at various stages including immediate post-submission (2O%) upon delivery of goods via lorry (another 2O%), subsequently completing drying process developments over one day post factory entry. There is optimism about forthcoming government policies supporting MOUs between producers/farmers like himself who seek greater flexibility in marketing their commodities efficiently while ensuring fair compensation practices are maintained throughout every transaction stage until final sales occur after product grading assessments have been completed inside factories designated by regulatory bodies such as KSDL & R&A
