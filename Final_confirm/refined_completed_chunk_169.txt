 The Indian agricultural sector is facing challenges, with some farmers resorting to suicide due to financial hardships. To address these issues and provide alternative livelihoods, the government has initiated the National Aavishkaar Bharti (NAB) Mission, now formally recognized as the National Afforestation Programme (NAP). Under this programme, farmers are encouraged to plant Sri Gandha trees on their land through a partnership between the forest department and local agriculturists. Over the past three years, Sri Gandha forests have expanded by 40 hectares annually. This initiative not only diversifies crops but also includes multicropping options like maval, cb guard trees for sapota nurseries. In its first year alone, 40,000 hectares were allocated to Sri Gandha cultivation; subsequently increased to 10,000 hectares in the second year and maintained at 50,00hectares over the subsequent two years.
The process involves obtaining seedlings from authorized sources such as Hulimawal's forest department after registration via websites like FruitsandHesaru or Mela Parvatangan Crop Management App Launch Pad Vizag-Andhra Pradesh Forest Department Farmer Portal Online Services Agribusiness Social Entrepreneurship Educational Consultancy Licensing Registration Certification Training Advising Local Government Non Profit Organization so that subsidies can be directly deposited into farmers' accounts using RTGS upon application submission.
Farmers are incentivized with an annual contribution of INR 125 per starter plant over three years under initiatives like SFURTI (Scheme for Funding Up-gradation & Restructuring of Existing CRYSPMAI Institutions), which supports small hydroelectric power projects among other sustainable practices. Additionally supported crops include unconventional ones like Hebevi seeds alongside traditional vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes. These efforts aim to empower farmers with diverse income streams while enhancing ecological conservation through afforestation efforts led by NAB/NAP mission programs across India since fiscal year 23-26 starting March 29th week every year according FM Shri Nirmala Sitharaman's announcement during Budget Speech 'Ek Kadam Weda Sarve Santu'.
