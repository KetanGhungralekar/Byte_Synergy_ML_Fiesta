The speaker, engaging with viewers about their aspirations for creating a beautiful forest, emphasizes that there is no rush to achieve this goal as ample time is available. They mention the challenges of communication during interactions with various individuals and how their team manages video production, editing, engagement with farmers, and executing projects while juggling limited time. They highlight the progress made in planting season detailed in the video's first part linked in the description. The project involves establishing a fully fenced area using mesh netting and an electric fence to protect it from intruders. This initiative aims to promote sustainable farming practices by inviting interested parties to register through a provided link for farm planning and execution support.
The speaker also addresses K 쳇 (Cutworms), which were previously considered pests but have been repurposed as beneficial organisms for providing nutrients to plants through parasitism without producing their own food resources independently. The demonstration showcases how these cutworms can contribute positively when fed properly and are positioned close enough—approximately one or two feet apart—to access tree roots for nutrient distribution across diverse planted trees within an irrigated setting that mimics natural forest conditions where trees grow naturally spaced amidst rich soil filled with organic matter locked at half-foot depths after 18-20 years of cultivation leading to abundant crop diversity upon maturity.
