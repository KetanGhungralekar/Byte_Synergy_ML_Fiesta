source I told you earlier, if you want to grow heartwood and oil content in this tree, you need to have enough light and oxygen Otherwise, if you water too much, heartwood will not grow Oil content quality will also be very low If you want to plant a host plant for Srikanda, the water content will be more dependent on the plants If you want to plant a host plant for Srikanda, the water content should not be more That too, should be Malayashrita's plant If you water that plant, it will affect Srikanda If you want to plant Srikanda, the space is also very important Because it is dependent on the host We need to give 5 feet of space for host and Srikanda If you give more space than 5 feet, the host plant will not be able to connect with the host plant It will be difficult to get water and nutrients We will also show the same example in the same garden If we look here, the space is 5 feet This tree is growing well If you look at the other tree in this garden it is not growing well Because the host plant is very far away If the host plant is very far away, it will not be able to get water and nutrients This tree is not growing well We call this tree as the wider adaptability crop Why? Because we can easily grow this tree in any environment If you give 10 feet of space for one tree, you can plant 160 trees This tree has been growing for 15 to 20 years This tree has been growing for 15 to 20 years So, from one tree we get 20 kg of hardwood From one tree we get 20 kg of hardwood From this market rate, we get 6,000 rupees for one tree From this market rate, we get 6,000 rupees for one tree If we plant 20 kg of hardwood from one tree, we can get 1,200,000 rupees If we plant 160 trees per acre, we can get 2 crores of money from 160 trees In between these trees, we can plant papaya, lemon, cardamom, and cinnamon We can plant these trees But if we want to grow this tree, the main problem is that it will be stung We can take this tree and go We have to protect this tree We have to protect this tree Since this tree is so low in production, and the demand is high, the government is supporting the tree The Karnataka government has made a project called Grow More Sandalwood to protect this tree First, we have to protect this tree by putting microchips This is a protection system from the government to protect this tree We have to protect trees by putting microchips We can put 8 feet of microchips in the trees to protect the trees Indian Wood Science and Technology has done this If a stone comes toSome people in the other side have more numbers.
