The course on Sri Gandha Agriculture outlines a profitable investment strategy in agricultural markets, particularly focusing on the cultivation of Shrikanda, an economically valuable produce. The course emphasizes that with the right approach and technology, a single acre of land can yield earnings of up to 3 crore rupees annually. It provides detailed guidance on the necessary discharge and threshold adjustments for optimization. The historical context notes that in 1960, India faced severe poverty with only 4,000 acres under cultivation. By contrast, as of 2026, India had transformed into a leading producer of Shrikanda spread over 29 million acres. With current demand hovering around 6-7 thousand tons yearly and rapid growth in cosmetic industries requiring Shrikanda ingredients, there's significant potential for farmers to capitalize on this crop.
