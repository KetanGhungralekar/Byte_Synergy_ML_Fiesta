 The paragraph discusses a situation involving Jalanamadu and Balanimadu projects, with a focus on the transportation and processing of an extremely dark-colored mineral or substance that resembles a diamond. This material is valuable and requires careful handling; cutting it yields immediate profit at 20%, followed by full payment after a month-long drying process. Over seven years, there has been continuous work related to these projects, including planting crops—specifically trees or saplings—on 7 acres (with some confusion mentioned regarding another figure), despite restrictions in a 30-acre protected area near Srikandha, which also houses "sisters' quarters" occupied by approximately 9,000 people. The net worth of this project is estimated at INR 90 crores (roughly USD 11 million). There are mentions of security measures such as live fencing and strict access controls in place around this sensitive area.
