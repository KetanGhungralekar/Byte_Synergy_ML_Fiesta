If you didn't come with an alarm, you can see how much protection you can give Now after the alarm is given, after the wall is built, why does the stone stick to the wall? Why does he stick the wall? He has a stick in his eyes, we put it in the wall He needs it, there is a number, 29 He will remove the number and stick the wall The upper part, we put the stick in the wall and put it in the wall Now how can we trace the chip? One thing, okay, so the chip is not that reliable If I close my eyes and put the chip in the wall, it will be completely lost What do I do for that? Many people think that if I put a chip in it, it will not be a problem The second problem is that one or two companies come from Mysore and say One year, they take 80 rupees and take the wall, one year later they come and say I will put a chip in it Now with the first one's intelligence, they come and put a chip in the wall for 8 years Okay, they come and put a chip in the wall for 8 years and the wall is small They are all fake companies, I came last year and I will give you free fencing, I will give you 50 rupees from the previous year I will give you free chip for 7 years, all these are fake, all these companies are frauds No one is coming from Mysore, that's what I am telling you If you want to do such a plantation, you have to take your responsibility Don't give your responsibility to anyone, don't do this to anyone When your dreams, your land, your money, all these are yours, why do you have a major concern? Security, if others don't go, they will believe and do it, that is my request This cost is 500 to 800, it costs 5 to 8 lakhs rupees per acre, again another problem I will tell you that, after that, another problem is that every 3 years you have to change the battery The battery cost is 50 to 70 rupees, if you change the cell, the same cell will come back to life But as of now, this chip will go out of the prototype for 1 to 2 years minimum If you want to give security to your dreams, you have to put a mesh on the border or a wire Then you have to put a dog with it on the border, then you have to install an alarm system called point sensors What point sensors do is, if someone is running at night, it will give you a signal and it will automatically start making sounds Leave all these and do this, I hope youliked this video, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask Please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate to ask, please do not hesitate That's a quest.
