To optimize the growth of heartwood and oil content in trees, adequate light and oxygen are essential, with careful attention to watering—too much can hinder heartwood development while significantly reducing oil quality. For hosting Srikanda plants, which require moderate water content that should not exceed, ideal host plants include those from the Malayashrita species; these must be within 5 feet of Srikanda to facilitate nutrient and water exchange without overcrowding. Space allocation is crucial: both the host plant and Srikanda need 5 feet each for optimal growth. In a garden setting observed, a tree located 5 feet from its host thrived due to proximity support, whereas another Tree spaced too far apart did not flourish due to insufficient resource transfer. Trees identified as 'wider adaptability crops' can be planted closely (10 feet between trees allows for up to 160 shrubs per acre), maximizing yield potential—each fully-grown tree yields about 20 kg of hardwood worth approximately INR 6,000; thus, an acre could potentially generate INR 2 crores when considering sales from all harvested hardwood combined. Additionally, intercropping spaces with papaya, lemon or citrus fruits like kagzi lime (suitable throughout India), cardamom varieties suited alternated rows during different seasons/years based on climate suitability recommendations made by Indian Wood Science & Technology along with crop rotation schemes put forth by experts in field related disciplines including agroforestry practices may consider integrating cinnamon into such mixed companionship systems if suitable habitats exist nearby but they have challenges when dealing malicious insect attacks requiring protective measures like microchips provided under government initiatives like Grow More Sandalwood project supported by Karnataka government aiming at protecting valuable sandalwood trees through advanced tech solutions against thefts etc., ensuring sustainable forest management practices leading towards biodiversity conservation efforts without compromising economic gains while providing ecosystem services benefits occur naturally .
