In Kottalagi village, within the Belagavi district's Atmeyar Raitar Taluk, a forward-thinking farmer named Sidra Irapa has innovatively transformed 10 acres of his land into a Srikantabhiladi farm in Hattige Hannahalli. This initiative was born out of necessity due to rising labor costs and expenses for cow dung and medication. Sidra's family had previously relied on traditional farming but shifted to this new venture as it allows self-reliance and sustainability. His decision to plant Srikantabhiladi trees stems from the realization that without diligent effort, investments would not bear fruit. He has planted over 300 trees across three acres, with each acre hosting around 325 saplings eachâ€”a testament to his commitment towards enhancing agricultural productivity and securing livelihoods for his family. The village now boasts an incredible capacity of producing between 100-200 acres per year under these conditions, marking a significant stride towards sustainable rural development in India.
