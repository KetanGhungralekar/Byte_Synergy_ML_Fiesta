You are supplying various trees and plants, including Jambu and Choco water (cacao), to a location. Malinadi will also be visiting this site. Among the plants supplied, the Rudrakshi tree is notable for its medicinal properties across all of its partsâ€”bark, flowers, leaves, and even sap. There is also Sita Ashoka and Saraka Ashoka used for therapeutic purposes. A significant highlight among these plants is Breva philom or Kadu Basale, which has been traditionally used as a remedy for kidney stones; treatment involves soaking 1 leaf with 5 curry leaves in water mixed with a bit of salt for five days to help dissolve stones naturally without surgery or medication typically costing lakhs (hundreds of thousands).
Breva philom grows within other leaves under favorable conditions from fertile soil rich in nutrients that support both shrubs like Vishmaya bush (also known as Breva philom) and larger trees within your "nature nursery." The Vishmaya bush can be planted locally or in pots due to its adaptability. It's remarkable how nature provides extensive healing potential through such flora without requiring artificial intervention or expensive treatments developed by modern medicine industries.
