Like what Panpara does, the base of Panpara. They should make a scent. The scent should be made from the oil of Srikanth. Otherwise the scent will not be used. For that we call it as Srikanth's fixed tea. Do you understand? Because of that property, they need that oil. They should make a plantation for that. That is why Srikanth is a country of our country. It is a country of different countries. They are growing interest. They are growing parties and farmers. They are doing NGO work. In Maharashtra, they are training. They are not training in nursery. They are not training in nursery. It is a non-traditional area. Do you understand the importance of that? Economic sector. I am not asking you all. I am asking about economics. Why should we know economics? Why? When we come to that, instead of Srikanth, if we want to compare Srikanth with something else, we should know Srikanth's economics. Because when we know Srikanth, we have more challenges. What did you say? How does Srikanth know agriculture? How does he know agriculture? We should know agriculture, see the damage done by Srikanth, do the right marketing, and even if we take money, we will still be challenging. So, when we get such challenging crops, if we know that other crops are better than this, and if we get good prices, we should know how much we can get from this. If we know how much we can get from this, if we have a method, we should take a decision to buy that or buy something else. Economics of Srikanth is very important. When we talk about economics of sandal, if we know the complex things that come with sandal, we can understand how much we can get from that. Here, the challenging crop is Srikanth. Because Srikanth is not one seed. We should grow another crop with that. We can call it an alternate host. It is grown in different stages, in different trees and is in front of us. So, it is very challenging. If we understand the complexity of all these things, we can understand economics. First, there is a good price for Srikanth, then there is a challenging crop, then there is the price for our crop, what is the alternate host, and we can understand that. So, economics will vary from that. So, selection of the alternate host is also important. Then, this is decision making. Decision making should be taken at every stage. At every stage, if you decide on which one to choose, you should observe the difference. Because I will tell you in the next slide. These are different crops. As we have already said, there are just these. This is the seed of Srikanth. It is growing in Andhra Pradesh. Srikanth is the name of that crop. But, we have not received any papers from this crop. So, we are not saying that it should be grown. Thisis a small tree.
