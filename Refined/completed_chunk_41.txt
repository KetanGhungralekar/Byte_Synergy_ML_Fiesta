I will talk to you. You are all rich. But not me. If I go for business, I and my wife and children will be poor. This is my situation. Why are you saying like this? I am not going to sell my house. I am going to sell my house. Why are you saying like this? Will someone steal money from there? Think about it. What are you saying? Don't you know? When the rich people are born, they are being harassed by the rich. The rich people will give the rich people money. I am a poor man. I am a poor businessman. That's why I said that the rich people are stealing money from there. I have planted the Rathna tree in your house. It is useless. Give them to the rich people. They will be happy to see the rich people. They will give them gold. What? Are you telling the truth? Yes, Muthu. They know the importance of the unformed tree. But Sanjeeva, Kesava, Appa has planted these trees. They should not plant these trees and do any work. It will clean the air and give good health. They said that it is not easy to get this unformed tree. I am telling the truth. It is true that Kesava and Sanjeeva are telling the truth. They can't earn by planting these trees. Why do you want to know the future of the rich people? I have thought about it. I have told the people to plant the Rathna tree and do some work. What are you saying? I don't agree to this. You tell me what you want. I will plant the tree. Greetings, Your Highness. You are the King of the Rathna tree. I am Muthu. I have brought some boys for your birthday. Is it? What are they? They are the peat plants from the Rathna tree. What? Rathna tree. It is a very special tree. Thank you very much. What do you want? How much money do you want? Soldiers, please give me the money and the flowers. Thank you for making me happy. Please take the money and flowers. Thank you, Your Highness. Mother, where are you? Muthu, your son has been poisoned. This is an unusual poison. Oh God, I will tell the doctor now. What is this? This is very dangerous. I will tell the doctor to get a tree for this. If he gives it to me, he will be fine. There is no other medicine other than that. If you tell me, I will take it wherever it is. That is the Rathna tree tree. You should give it to him and take him to this poison place. But it is very difficult to get such a precious medicine. I will tell the doctor. I will give you a lot of money. You should not do any work that involves building a house. I have no money. I have no money. You cannot kill mewith money.
