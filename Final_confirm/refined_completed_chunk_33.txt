The Kempu Chandana plant, historically significant in China and crucial for the Shrikhandi species' growth, requires careful management due to its inhibitory effect on tree development. This plant is typically 150-175 cm tall when mature and can reach up to 9 meters with proper care. Over three years, it has been observed growing by 6 meters under optimal conditions. However, it struggles with high temperatures and necessitates a strategy involving Manu Crotophage application twice weekly during April to May to mitigate its negative impact on growth. Despite these challenges, Kempu Chandana trees are also valued for their medicinal properties; they are often cultivated as part of a tree's therapeutic garden but must be managed due to their tendency to monopolize nutrients in the soil upon reaching maturity. If not controlled properly, this could lead to stunted growth or crop failure among associated plants.
In terms of economics, maintaining Kempu Chandana trees involves substantial investment—20-30 acres of land—and manifests both risks and rewards; potential profits range from Rs 2 lakh per liter if well managed up to Rs 25 crores across larger expanses like hundreds of acres (upwards of twelve hundred thirty acres specifically mentioned). However, the reliance on seasonal rainfall poses significant financial risk as drought can drastically reduce yields while simultaneously increasing production costs without ensuring returns sufficient enough even after decades of laborious effort ("blood money"). Additionally, uncontrolled expansion faces environmental concerns leading potentially detrimental outcomes that outweigh any economic gains made through aggressive farming practices targeting large profit margins (making anywhere between one crore rupees upward depending on diligent work). The knowledge exchange about Shrikanth's agricultural endeavors was shared by Munir Reddy at an educational visit conducted near Malvali Talukkum in Rithanapuram district where DMS engaged actively in understanding sustainable farming practices tailored for optimizing such specialized crops within existing ecological constraints while ensuring commercial viability for farmers involved during previously challenging periods prompting them toward selling off assets prematurely owing mainly losses endured despite immense efforts invested over time against adverse odds set forth by nature itself .
