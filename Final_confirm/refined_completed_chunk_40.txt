 Sri Gandha Baliya, an ancient agricultural venture, has faced significant financial challenges with continuous losses over time. Despite this, the maintenance costs remain high at Rs. 50-50 (likely a typographical error indicating a consistent amount) per month. The narrator emphasizes the struggle of managing finances for such expenses while also highlighting the importance of hard work and patience to potentially turn profit within 15 years if properly cared for. With efforts put into expanding the land from mere acres to nearly 700 acres over two decades, there is optimism about future returns in farming based on lessons passed down through generations. The family behind Sri Gandha Baliya hopes that by preserving their heritage and investing wisely in agriculture, they can achieve economic stability and prosperity eventually leading to comfortable living conditions without being reliant on external aid or beggingâ€”a poignant reflection on their current socioeconomic situation. The narrator concludes by expressing aspirations for a better life for his mother as well as himself, despite facing poverty and comparing themselves to friends who have found success elsewhere through different means of earning money.
