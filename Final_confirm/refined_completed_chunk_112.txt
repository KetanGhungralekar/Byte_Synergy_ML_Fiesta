The soil maintenance involves carefully managing the rake, which is a critical component for plant growth. Ideally, the rake should be trimmed by half an inch to prevent it from being damaged. This precaution ensures its longevity and effectiveness in irrigation through drip systems. For the plants, proper pruning is essential; cutting more than necessary can hinder their development whereas leaving half an inch allows natural growth without harming the plants. The Sosi species from Srikandu are of interest as they have potential commercial value; previously collected seeds from these plants were successfully purchased back, indicating a viable market practice.
Srikandu has been profitable since its inception and has generated enough revenue to compensate for open market purchases initially restricted by government policies. Despite higher costs abroad, local production benefits from favorable conditions set by government support after 15 years of cultivation led to significant growth of the crop among farmers who have demonstrated successful yields observed in videos disseminated by relevant parties or authorities responsible for agricultural progression in that region (possibly including research institutes).

Market demand currently sits at around 16000 per kg with positive sentiments about future pricing stability based on recent developments and trials conducted within approximately 5 acres designated for Srikandu farmingâ€”a figure that may expand considering historical practices where farmers rotated between one to two acres dedicated solely to this crop before diversifying their activities over time due to various circumstances such as disease resistance or other resource management imperatives given older age trends detected amongst existing stocks that require careful drenching treatment post-harvest period when necessary but cannot impede overall agroecosystem health negatively impacting other coexisting vegetations totaling around X square kilometers (with 'X' measured in forests growing alongside agricultural lands).
