1. A royal party distributed 10 sasi to Hager Wood, which has been used for wood grafting with normal weather conditions suitable for post-hunting operations. The process requires careful scientific methods and involves the use of hayal in thickening the wood; however, it's a costly procedure that takes at least 20 years to mature for significant yields but potentially as little as 15-16 years under optimal conditions.

2. On an acre of land, between 150 to 200 saplings can be planted without overcrowding; higher densities may impede growth. This practice is part of various agricultural schemes supported by extensive research involving multiple training programs over several years, culminating in certificate distribution and potential loan opportunities for farmers who engage in these practices profitably on Kasgi lands.

3. Since gaining authorization from the government (from 2014-15), efforts have focused on increasing production from around 1-2 tons initially upwards towards achieving a goal of growing up to ten tons within six to seven years through continuous cultivation strategies like intercropping or mixed cropping where other crops might include potatoes or radishes alongside Srikandha plants whose roots penetrate deeply enriching the soil while simultaneously yielding substantial profits that can reach well into hundreds of thousands per hectare when grown sustainably over timeâ€”similar results are expected if applying these techniques across about half an acreage annually using different crop rotations including haldi/turmeric cultivation whose market demand remains constant despite seasonal fluctuations due its medicinal properties and versatile uses both nutritionally and commercially.
