Kavitha Muma Shankara Mishra is a resident of Tavuramani, Rayachur, where she married and settled after receiving her education in Dharwada. She has been engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry on the family farm. Despite initial challenges—such as lacking basic infrastructure like electricity and water supply—and facing societal disapproval due to superstitions about the land, Kavitha and her husband have transformed their 8-acre plot over 13-14 years. They succeeded in levelling rocky terrain that was previously barren into productive farmland. Kavitha holds a Diploma in Computer Science from Karnataka University and an MI in Sociology; however, she chose to dedicate herself full-time to farming instead of pursuing a career at Infosys due to personal circumstances. With her programming skills acquired during her diploma days, she remains open to integrating technology with agriculture for further improvement on the farm amidst challenging climatic conditions exceeding 45 degrees Celsius without adequate facilities like doors or proper ventilation. Her journey exemplifies resilience, commitment, and transformation against significant odds.
