For over seven centuries, the resinous tree known as 'bloodline' has held significant medicinal value in China and neighboring regions like Japan and Mongolia. During the 14th century Ming dynasty, the bloodline trees were utilized for royal palace decorations, with evidence of their use still present in Chinese museums today. Despite their historical importance, these trees faced threats from foreign countries cutting them down. However, China implemented measures to conserve them by manually harvesting sap from individual trees and other areas where they grow. This sustainable practice allows recovery from thousands of diseases at their root cause while preserving the precious stock of these ancient treesâ€”some of which can live for a million years if cultivated successfully and take around 30 years to mature after felling versus 15 years for a plantation-grown tree under proper conditions.
The intensity of demand on the international market poses challenges; smugglers supply approximately 20 trillion Indian rupees worth of bloodline annually into commerce across borders illegally. Efforts by the government include imposing severe penalties (up to 15 years imprisonment) against those caught trafficking these native species. Preservation efforts are critical as one hectare provides enough raw material to meet annual global healthcare needs without compromising future generations' access or environmental integrity due to unsustainable practices
