In a heartfelt plea, a farmer seeks forgiveness from the trees for inadvertently harming them while fulfilling his duty to protect crops. He recounts how his actions were necessitated by the destruction of their land due to a pest infestation. The farmer expresses regret and vows to revere and plant trees as his father did. Dr. Sivanan, Dean of Aranya Mahavidya and owner of the Srikandas crop, addresses concerns raised by farmers regarding protection against stone-throwing damage during lectures presented at Kishanwarthi.com. He clarifies that there are no restrictions on planting Srikandas but advises caution amidst confusion about permissions and varieties.

Dr. Sivanan explains that though six species emit similar odors associated with Srikanda, true identification requires botanical distinction between 'vriki' (variety) and 'jati' (species). Farmers often misuse these terms interchangeably which leads to misunderstandings related to cultivation practices like sapling transplantation over distances where soil conditions vary significantlyâ€”a process expected to take approximately 16 years if done correctly using Paravalambi plants approved since 2050 AD, despite initial prohibitions requiring official permission for large-scale farming initiatives involving this particular leguminous species known for its ability to support diverse vegetative growth including beets when planted alongside it under government sanctioned guidelines post its approval date mentioned above..
