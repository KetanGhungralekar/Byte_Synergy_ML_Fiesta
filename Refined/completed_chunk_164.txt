We don't have the old days to do anything. I have given him a lot of money to build a house. He didn't give me a single torch. He didn't give me the right to study. Then, I don't know when he will get his eyes back. I don't know how he will live. I don't know what to do. After every 12 hours, they wear black clothes. They watch us, madam. They come to the beach. They come to the beach. They don't come on the main road. They come to the beach after every 12 hours. Power action. They have all these things. They watch us in the morning. They watch how much wood is there. They come. They come every 12 hours. They watch us. We are here in Ababurna. When they come, they don't cut the machine. They cut it and then they come. Madam, we... They come from the village. They come from the village. They come from Nayanalli. If you hit the stone and break the stone, what will they do? There were 63 home guards in the city of Vishwavidyan. It's impossible to do anything. There are only 5 entrances around Vishwavidyan. But there are no check posts. During our reality check, police were checking vehicles. But they weren't checking the vehicles coming from the campus of Vishwavidyan. Our country, our forest, and our people, who don't love our wealth, are not able to do anything for the welfare of the society. These officials and representatives are making a mess and making a mess for the trees of our forest. It's a crime to build these smelly houses. It's our duty to build these houses. But the people of Anandi, the police and the university are forgetting their duty. The government should take a tough action against these officials. Otherwise, these smelly houses will be destroyed in the next day. I'll be back with another sports story. See you soon for Kshana Kshana Sudhi.
