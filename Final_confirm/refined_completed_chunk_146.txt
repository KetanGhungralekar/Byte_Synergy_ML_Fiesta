In the demonstration provided by their friend, Pawan.Krd showcases an experiment involving Srikant's 7th year plant—referred to as 'head' or 'canopy'—highlighting the significance of host and light for its development. The hostel-housed plant reached only 10 feet in height due to a restricted environment, while the non-hosteled natural house grew significantly taller without any intervention, reaching up to 20 feet with excellent productivity.
The key findings were that proper sunlight access is crucial; buildings with single walls instead of multiple layers hindered growth because they blocked out sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. A competent light-demanding plant grows faster towards the sunshine, displaying a noticeable difference in growth patterns between hosteled and non-hosteled plants. Moreover, small walls under shade did not contribute to wood production despite being over 6 feet tall due to insufficient solar exposure compared to equivalent structures made from mahogany (450) paired with Srikant (450).
Pawan emphasizes that approximately 900 wooden stakes can be produced from one acre of such trees if managed correctly. He urges children who provide incorrect information about farming practices based on flawed experiments or observations affecting farmers' livelihoods negatively by perpetuating misconceptions rather than promoting agricultural best practices effectively. To rectify this issue, Pawan suggests disseminating knowledge about obtaining quality produce for better farm outcomes and farmer profits through accurate data sharing among stakeholders involved in agriculture education initiatives like Kisan Kranti Yatra proposed earlier this month during Krishi Jankari conclave held at Bikaner Rajasthan covering six states including Punjab Haryana UP Maharashtra Gujarat & Rajasthan where students had an opportunity learn directly from expert growers returning back with handsfull insights feed into curriculum improvements aiming towards supporting sustainable agriculture across India efficiently providing solutions tailored according regional needs thus contributing positively socio economic welfare especially focusing on youth engagement within rural landscape fostering innovation entrepreneurship leading towards empowerment through self reliance advancing world class standards creating global impact locally leveraging indigenous wisdom integrating modern technology ensuring win win situations all round !
