750 acres of farmland were successfully irrigated using a system that waters 2 acres daily with the help of coconut water mixed into the irrigation. The farmers ensured efficient water usage by not overusing coconut and alternating with mud watering once a year. To maintain optimal conditions for a good harvest, they balance mixing some coconut water with ensuring there's no excess to address potential gaps. They have set up a robust irrigation system capable of sustaining more than 15 years without significant issues, which is expected to cost around INR 1.25 crores (roughly USD 16,430). Despite challenges like fluctuating market prices due to varied demand and supply dynamics influenced by natural events like pulses or tomato gluts/scarcities, the farmers are resilient in their approach but face financial hurdles such as losing INR 40,000 due to unchangeable circumstances beyond their control. Legal obstacles prevent them from sourcing seeds freely; instead, they must rely on domestically milled oil for machinery used in farming operations after obtaining legal sanction.
