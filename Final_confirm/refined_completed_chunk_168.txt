6-year-old Sri Gandhada fields in India cover approximately 12 acres within survey number 59 of a semi-settled village. The area cultivates around 2000 trees, primarily with the support of Sri Gandhada Paravalambi Gita. Farmers observed that these trees require abundant water and have successfully irrigated them using drip systems for two years. Pruning is conducted selectively to encourage growth; farmers remove about three feet from the lower part of matured trees but avoid extensive cutting.

The soil quality varies among local departments, which predict a decade or more before optimal conditions are achieved; however, one farmer believes it will take at least two decades based on his experience starting six years ago. Currently, there's an initiative where over 500 farmers are planting mango varieties alongside vegetables like tomatoes, beans, papaya, and avarega under the existing shade provided by matured coconut trees as they aim to diversify their agriculture produce.

Despite efforts to sustain tree growth—including seeking government subsidies for protective measures against animals and fires—farmers face challenges such as arson attacks leading to losses due to scented smoke affecting nearby administrative offices and forests. There is an urgent call for better protection policies from both state actors and corporate entities involved in purchasing agricultural products like soap derived from these oils (with operations both locally in Maratha and globally out of Bengaluru). The financial health of farming communities remains precarious; crop fluctuations can lead not only to economic stress but also tragic consequences like suicides driven by desperation over debt burdens related directly or indirectly to unsustainable practices without adequate support mechanisms in place for resilience building against market volatility
