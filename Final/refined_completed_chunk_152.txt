To prepare for the pitting process, which is essential for cultivation, one must apply to the forest department and secure a subsidy. The pittings are planted in June, coinciding with the onset of marking. Pitting should be conducted between January and February, or during March and April when the soil receives sufficient sunlight to warm up. The ideal depth for pitting is 40-50 cm to match the size of seedlings precisely. Prior to planting, which should occur a month before actual sowing (in May), an annual preparation of pits ensures they retain uniform size throughout the year.
During planting season in June, after removing plastic covers from seedlings, it's crucial to integrate formadin into the soil for better water retention capabilities without compromising drainage; this is facilitated by flood irrigation techniques used post-planting. Proper timing allows for successful germination despite occasional rainfall interruptions that could otherwise hinder early growth stages of newly planted seeds.
