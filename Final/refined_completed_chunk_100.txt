The individual in question is unaware of the true cost of his decisions regarding land use and tree conservation. He seems to prioritize payment over environmental concerns, as he pays for bird-harvested coconutsâ€”specifically 1 kg for 10,00 rupees, with an intention to purchase up to 10 kg at that rate. These birds are feeding on imported trees which are expensive due to their contents beneficial for soil fertility such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium (mentioned multiple times), sulfur, gibberellins, arginine cytokinins aminos among others. The person emphasizes the importance of these nutrients and acknowledges that mixing them with a little white element produces significant results; this process costs him 1000 rupees per 36 kg of earth carried annually by birds.
He underscores the role of birds in sustaining forest health by transporting substantial amounts of soil each year without artificial items like shampoo or plastics. Despite challenges faced by late arrivals affecting half their knowledge transfer potential during workshops intended for educating locals about wildlife preservation areas within forests where one can observe nesting behavior close up after informing participants not to disturb them upon arrival since they may already be delayed halfway through their duties/intentions.
This individual is committed to engaging with local communities on these issues despite personal hardships including family responsibilities and job dissatisfaction but remains hopeful that some understanding can be achieved even if some individuals have traveled far yet fail to attend promptly or fully grasp the material presented when present
