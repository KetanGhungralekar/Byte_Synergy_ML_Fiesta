10 members of a team led by Kattigana ventured into a village in Pakistan to investigate smugglers. Initially, they suspected the smugglers had spent a night there, but upon interaction with locals, the atmosphere did not seem intimidating. A group of people at the village's center became suspicious and fled when confronted. The team then stumbled upon an ongoing illegal blood money operation facilitated by local villagers who believed them to be thieves initially. They were offered 10% of the stolen funds as their share for participating in the theft. Baba, one of the smugglers, provided his contact number for further coordination; however, after acknowledging that no one from Andhra Pradesh would supply the money without prior knowledge or suspicion, they decided against pursuing this illicit activity despite waiting anxiously for instruction from Baba. When delegated to collect payment at a nearby shop by 'the dealer,' Kattigana felt apprehensive as soon as he called Baba's number and found it disconnected—contrary to expectations that simply reactivating it would resolve issues. Their fears escalated when they reached the water source seeking refuge; they perceived an immediate threat leading them to believe their lives were buried along with any hope of escape once encountered face-to-face with potential enemies among nearly 20 armed men—possibly policemen or journalists based on descriptions given during questioning hours earlier that day which included suggestions such as "Let's go left," "Go up," and "Where is our vehicle?" Eventually finding themselves surrounded and outnumbered while fleeing towards Neelagiri Top via road after crossing challenging terrain due to pursuit by another hostile group determined not only to catch but perhaps condemn them falsely if opportunity allowed amidst public scrutiny or deception involving law enforcement officials involved accidentally accused murdered victims whom they mistakenly assumed were innocent individuals obstructing justice under false pretenses..
