The speaker has established a farm aimed at empowering youth through practical, income-generating opportunities. The farm is designed to demonstrate how young individuals can earn significantly without monetary investment; currently, they are generating around Rs. 10,000 per month from an initial investment of Rs. 50,000 by employing scientific methods that cannot be learned merely by watching videos online. The farmer emphasizes the potential for youths to transform their lives and the country's future if they engage in productive activities rather than migrating for low-paying jobs or indulging in vices as suggested by their lawyer.
The farm incorporates various initiatives such as developing a borewell system for irrigation and cultivating diverse crops like grains, vegetables, fruits like litchi and dragon fruit, poultry (including chickens), livestock (pigs and eagles), and exotic animals (bloodhounds, hyenas). Located in Nyasargeet within Savaiyavad district of Gujarat state in India, this educational agricultural hub not only provides sustenance but also offers training programs where visitors can observe its operations firsthand. The unique aspect of this model farm lies in its holistic approach towards sustainable livingâ€”combining crop production with ecological harmony to ensure peacefulness and contentment among residents while serving as a fertile learning ground for youth interested in agriculture and entrepreneurship.
