 In the Malinand region, the white soil is scarce, leading to challenges in art food formation and high accumulation. Rainfall is insufficient, yet vegetative growth remains vigorous. It has been estimated by mathadavakas that it takes approximately 20 to 25 years for optimal production from these lands. Visitors interested in cultivation can consult them directly at 9 a.m., as local experts like Mr. Idrukula can provide valuable insights into early induction of art work which may not be accessible elsewhere due to secondary metabolism constraints.
After visiting the Malinand area five years prior, an individual received eight young girls from just three initially planted specimens within two years – an exceptional result attributed to fortunate conditions and careful tending. The propagated plants are subjected to X-rays (X-го) followed by Christ testing before deciding on their use or significance in artistic endeavors and environmental enhancement efforts, ensuring they contribute positively post mortem or absence of caretakers who continue nurturing them as part of their legacy and obligation towards maintaining a thriving ecosystem rich with life's essential elements such as health, vision, spirituality alongside artistry embedded within this unique natural habitat whose transformative power through human intervention has been demonstrated repeatedly over time despite its initial resource limitations.
