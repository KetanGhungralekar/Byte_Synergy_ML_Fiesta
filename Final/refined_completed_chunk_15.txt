 farmer, Venkatappa from Virajasannapuram in Chitrakoot, Karnataka, has implemented a sustainable water collection system that utilizes rainwater harvested by natural structures resembling bear traps. This innovative approach not only serves as an efficient water source but also aligns with his goal of assisting the underprivileged in his village. By encouraging tree plantation using seeds like thoeser and sargal plants on a regular basis, he aims to improve soil health and provide additional benefits to the local ecosystem. Additionally, he has shared informative videos about their efforts on YouTube and social media platforms where they have received positive feedback for their initiative aimed at helping the poor within the community. Despite initial resistance from some farmers who were hesitant to adapt this new method despite its low cost (Rs 10 per meter), many are now willing to pay rent for these systems due to their effectiveness in conserving waterâ€”a critical resource during times of scarcity or drought conditions.
