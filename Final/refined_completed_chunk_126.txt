 In the discussion, the importance of cost-effective measures to protect resources was emphasized. Measures include installing cameras, sensors, traps, dogs, and constructing fencing without necessarily building a full compound. A significant solution involves using thorny bamboo; planting it at 5 feet will result in a mature height of 20 feet suitable for live fencing and as a windbreaker. For larger enclosures, planting bamboo at 20 feet apart can provide sufficient material for fences. The area also features diverse flora such as spices like strawberry, star gooseberry (Garcinia indica included), cardamom, cloves, cinnamon along with fruits like egg fruit which is beneficial for liver health and blood circulation due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The local ecosystem includes native species from Malaynad like coffee plants alongside others like Elaki trees that grow on the ground but are commonly harvested without uprooting themâ€”a practice referred to as 'vadasuri.'
The area also showcases an artificial creation of specific climatic conditions through strategic landscaping that favors shade-loving species to maintain humidity levels and reduce waste by reusing materials such as coffee leaves locally known as 'kari menusu.' This approach maximizes resource efficiency while creating an abundance of aromatic herbs within the environmentally rich zone near Bishil Nadu but cultivated with elements reminiscent of both Bharathanadu and Malaynad's southern region. Additionally mentioned were ornamental red fruit crops called Bokova recognized for their beauty and functionality as miracle fruits capable of enhancing food flavors when consumed unripe via mulching techniques used to suppress weeds growth complemented by intercropping systems featuring star fruit trees among other vegetation types present in this biodiverse setting.
