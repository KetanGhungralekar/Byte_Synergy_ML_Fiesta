The individual has been cultivating mulberry trees for 20 years and boasts a successful harvest where 1 kg of mulberry now fetches an impressive 16 lakh rupees (1.6 million INR). To calculate potential earnings from selling 600 pairs, one would multiply the number of pairs by the weight per pair and then by the price per kilogram. The speaker emphasizes the importance of diversification in farming, highlighting that if a single tree fails, relying on other livelihood components such as chickens, mutton, fish, or even a small garden becomes crucial. They advocate against merely establishing a small garden for personal use without considering marketability; instead suggesting to cultivate it commercially and sell produce for profit.
Furthermore, they discuss agricultural practices suited for dry land conditions where planting trees is preferred over seeking 'air' solutions to water scarcity issues. A strategy involving creating silage bases is proposedâ€”storing it during winter months to later support tree growth when opened up after drying out. This approach demonstrates their deep understanding of agroecological systems with an emphasis on commercial viability rather than traditional subsistence farming methods currently practiced by farmers who are often criticized here for focusing solely on monetary gain rather than sustainable agriculture practices that ensure overall well-being and fairness within rural communities.
