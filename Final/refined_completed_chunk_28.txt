After expressing gratitude for the support received for their project on 25% land, the speaker acknowledges contributions over four years to the local government in Rona and emphasizes the need for subsidies. They inspire confidence by mentioning a place called Sasi, where up to 300 units can be produced on an acre of land. The speaker identifies themselves as hailing from Huttukavur, inviting viewers to experience it firsthand.
The video also highlights historical aspects of India's golden age during ancient times attributed to its natural resources once owned by the Heralas. Despite invasions by the Haryas and potential loss, India remains populous with similar ancestral bloodlines intact. This is further illustrated through cultural references like Pushpa Murari's painting and scientific discoveries such as Tera corpus centillinus in South Indiaâ€”the most superior bloodline tree species found at the southern tip of Andhra Pradesh.
The discussion then shifts to the unique properties of this 'bloodline' tree: it weighs one kilogram solid and is estimated to be approximately 20-30 thousand times stronger than common trees; a ten-ton specimen can hold upwards of 20-30 kilograms solid without breaking down or tilting even slightly under pressure due to its dense structure which makes smuggling profitable (potentially yielding Rs 6 lakh per tree) given its rarity being restricted mostly to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh states within India. Dueto these qualities, security forces have been assigned guardianship roles over these precious trees which are crucial not just historically but also medically important because they were used in Ayurvedic practices before evolving into treatments for skin diseases today while maintaining relevance across various pharmaceutical applications elevating them among costly medicinal plants with high market value inclusive equating their worth potentially likening that of oil reserves globally despite scarcity within India itself .
