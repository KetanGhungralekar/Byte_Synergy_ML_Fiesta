After purchasing a Sari in Srinagar, understanding the right time to cut it for optimal growth is crucial. It's important to harvest from smallest to largest as needed, allowing them space to expand. Nine elderly individuals sourced their seeds from a forest after consulting with foresters who had cultivated them for about 10 years. The seeds have a pleasant fragrance but one type has an unusual odor too. In Srikanth, tree felling operations cost approximately Rs.50-100 per acre and yield substantial returns; over 16 years, landowners can expect earnings ranging from Rs.3-10 crores per acre, with even recent harvests netting around Rs.20 lakh per acre before expenses such as annual maintenance fees of up to Rs.20 lakhs that must be paid if no action is taken to manage the area sustainably . A significant investment of at least Rs.3-4 lakhs annually is required for proper management, which includes irrigation improvements due to reduced natural water flow during non-action periods. The establishment cost for constructing infrastructure on 10 acres in Karnataka or Maharashtra should be communicated clearly to farmers, emphasizing that these methods are superior and specific only to certain states within India (Karnataka/Maharashtra), suggesting unique conditions favorable for this practice there compared elsewhere in the country.[Note: There seems to be some repetition and inconsistency in financial figures provided; please clarify before final implementation.]
