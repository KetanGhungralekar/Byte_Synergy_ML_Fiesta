The wall in question has been standing for 18 to 25 years and is equipped with a new security measure involving the installation of a chip designed to protect against tampering, which is subjected to testing. A mesh has been added to further enhance protection by preventing physical interference. The wall's sensor effectiveness extends upwards from approximately 5 feet above the ground due to olfactory intrusions at lower levels, necessitating the placement of the sensor within this range for optimal performance.
The security chip installed costs between 500 to 800 rupees and measures 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches. Despite its camouflage design intended to blend into the wall visually, it remains noticeable because of its size and color discrepancies. In earlier prototypes, this chip was attached directly onto an eight-foot pole or handle but proved too visible when operational; therefore, modifications were made so that when cutting vibrations emitted during insertion—a step taken likely for noise reduction purposes—it generates similar vibrations without facilitating tracing efforts if attempted tampering triggers an alarm system response instead of a visual inspection targeting color matching or attempts at disabling through more invasive means like physically cutting into it (which would activate any alarms).
