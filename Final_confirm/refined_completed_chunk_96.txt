900 temples have been successfully constructed, marking a significant achievement and a blessing. This initiative is part of tree-based agriculture, which has resulted in a successful harvest. The forest conservation laws were respected until recently when an exception began for temple building due to the recognized need for such structures amidst agricultural efforts. A senior figure from the community passed away with valuable insights that could have further prepared the team had he lived longer. He was instrumental in leading temple construction initiatives on land previously used by forests. With his leadership, blocks of land are being cultivated to ensure favorable prices for farmers, thereby potentially transforming their lives economically as well as mentally and socially over time through these reforms; influencing multiple villages within this paradigm shift known as 'replicate'. One replicated success can expand up to 10 times its original size (from one acre to 100 acres). In Bishul village specifically, hill development complemented by robust rainfall supports rice cultivation among farmers who stand to benefit greatly from these changes. These developments aim not only to improve individual lives but also foster mutual respect and appreciation between communities despite differences in preference or opinion regarding certain areas/places (Koppal district, Raichur district, Ballari district). Overall, there is optimism towards creating better living conditions while preserving environmental regulations sensitively balancing human needs and eco-friendly practices.
