The agricultural practices discussed involve replacing all plants from Sanlu students as part of a sanitary percentage metric, which farmers monitor closely to maintain optimal plant health. Farmers are advised to cultivate during the rainy season after three to four years of preparation based on belief in the rain's timing. After these initial years, yields begin to produce crops sustainably. The discussion also covers nutrient requirements; while complete reliance on mineral and urea fertilizers isn't necessary, supplementing with organic waste such as tea leaves or prunings can enhance leafiness and growth without full dependency on synthetic inputs.

Regarding oil crop development, persistent opinions vary from 10 to 20 years for adequate maturation; however, with access to natural ingredients and an accommodating environment, it is possible within approximately 4-7 years post-plantation depending on conditions and maintenance efforts. A personal example suggests that although oil content may initially be low when harvested at this accelerated timeline (after four years), further improvements are observed over time up until ten years of growthâ€”a process farmland has demonstrated successfully in their garden setting according to practical experience shared by the speaker who has witnessed this firsthand along with evidence backing its feasibility found in literature recommendations for natural farming techniques leading up sustainable production cycles for various crops like oilseed trees.
