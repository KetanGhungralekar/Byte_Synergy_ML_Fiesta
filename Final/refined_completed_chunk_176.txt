The area in question is secured with traps and has strict access controls. Only two individuals can lift 10 kg safely within this zone, which requires navigating through these security measures. The location is equipped with surveillance systems that provide immediate alerts upon movement via a mobile system connected to a car parked on site. These protections are managed through programs based in India.

For those who come for work, collaboration is necessary; there cannot be solo attempts due to the multiparameter requirements of the task at hand, which involves constructing something akin to Srikandhaâ€”a structure mentioned in ancient Indian texts. The thickness of the Srikandha should not adhere strictly to linear measurements as it needs to allow for circulation and must account for factors like bark thickness and secondary metabolites (like resins) that serve as natural defenses against decay without compromising the quality or age of the sandalwood tree (which here appears to be five years old). The tree exhibits signs of stress but also rapid growth due to induced art formation processes, which do not negatively impact its market value despite being non-commercial yet as it ages beyond four years. Challenges related to protection include ensuring high security while managing wildlife interactions around sandalwood trees whose growth patterns show resistance under stress conditions when provided with adequate nutrition and care such as watering and fertilization with coconut waste products
