 A sustainable agricultural model is proposed where farmers can cultivate a variety of crops, including annual agriculture crops and oilseeds. After approximately 18-20 years, they will gain ownership of the land. The key aspect of this model is the establishment of a food forest with diverse plantings, aiming to ensure food security and conservation of forests by planting 50-60 trees per acre. This approach provides wood for the forest while sustaining farmers with multiple varieties of seeds such as red and gold types or peanut butter tomato seeds. Farmers are encouraged to grow both short-, medium-, and long-term crops to secure their food supply upon retirement. One successful crop mentioned is tomatoes, which can yield up to 10 tons per acre under optimal conditions.
The ecosystem diversification involves growing different types of non-hybrid corn—distinguished by being either chemically treated or grown in 'scuba soil' conditions—to enhance resilience against pests and diseases without relying on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Proper farming techniques are recommended for each type to prevent destruction from environmental factors while optimizing crop health through additional oxygen provided to chemical corn Treatments used include natural fertilizers like compost instead of synthetic chemicals.
Specifically, Sri Gandhaka trees are highlighted due to their unique characteristics as hemiparasitic species; unlike typical trees that rely solely on photosynthesis, these trees derive nutrients from other plants hosts, altering the dynamics within an agroforestry system when interplanted among conventional tree species.
