The Jogimatti forest in Chitradurga, Karnataka, has seen an increase in growth within its forestry industry due to the efforts of authorities aimed at protecting the environment and preventing offences such as illegal logging. The focus on conservation is crucial, especially with the high demand for red sandalwood, which is both valuable and illegally traded in India and abroadâ€”particularly in China, Japan, and Myanmar. In these regions, red sandalwood fetches prices upwards of 2-3 crores per ton when smuggled. However, legal purchase from the forest department offers a sustainable alternative to this lucrative black market trade.

In parallel to environmental protection initiatives like those in Sri Gandhada Nadu region of Karnataka where farmers are now cultivating their crops after receiving government encouragement over recent years; individual success stories emerge. One such example is Gopalakrishna from Bailusime village near Kolara taluk who has transformed his 12-acre plot into a thriving garden within a small hamlet named Gopalakrishnanagar (Gokarna). This move towards agricultural expansion by local farmers underlines their commitment to improving livelihoods while contributing positively to regional biodiversity preservation efforts.
