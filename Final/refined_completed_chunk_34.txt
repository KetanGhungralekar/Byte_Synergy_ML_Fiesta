100 crores was the selling price for a house, with potential earnings of up to a crore per day upon sale. However, each sale incurs a loss for the farmers who constructed these houses. The houses available are Raktachandana and White, and there's also a third type called Shrikanth. Shrikanth is equivalent to Raktachandana, which has been priced appropriately given its quality as indicated by the state minister's investment of 100 crores into developing this area with proper land support structures. Construction wise, it requires internal framing for stability while ensuring that trees are not damaged during building processes; approximately 10 feet of wood (with one and half feet mixed with mud and coconut) is used per tree for strength and filtration purposes. A combination of small seeds, big seeds, and supportive framework helps prevent overgrowth or encroachment issues under normal circumstances when trees would naturally migrate towards moisture sources unless intentionally restricted. For Srikanth specifically, attention must be given to maintain an appropriate space around the tree after removing its protective cover/dome using government-supplied filter coconuts blended with soil at full depth knotting without creating gaps that could lead to overgrowth or erosion concerns due to heavy rainfall or watering practices that include utilizing drip irrigation systems when necessary in times of drought or no natural precipitation
