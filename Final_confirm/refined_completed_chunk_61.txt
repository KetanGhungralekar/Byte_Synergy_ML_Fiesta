 The speaker conveys a sense of urgency about the state of their land, which is currently being used as rental property and generating minimal returns after 15 years of growing Srikandha. They highlight that the current model is unsustainable and not yielding adequate profits to justify the costs involved, especially with expenditures reaching up to 10-15 lakhs without significant revenue from rainfall or sales. To address this issue, they are advocating for cost reduction strategies and adopting sustainable practices through an initiative named Grow Forestry. This initiative has already utilized 8 acres of land planted with various crops like Srikandha (600 seedlings), Betel nut (100 plants), Coconut palms (100 trees), Water chestnuts (300 plants), Honey production (beehives count unspecified) at different stages of development.
The individual emphasizes that every square foot of agricultural land should be valued and Productively used to maximize its economic potential while minimizing waste. Additionally, they suggest shifting focus from selling at potentially low prices to optimizing savings by cutting down unnecessary expenses related to cultivation. By doing so, financial gains could double from what would typically be earned if products were sold cheaply, thus making farming more profitable and sustainable in line with natural processes rather than against themâ€”a philosophy they advocate for out of concern for both environmental sustainability and supporting impoverished communities financially struggling under heavy debt burdens due to high farming costs. Their message is clear: change course by reducing expenses, going with nature's flow instead of against it; save where possible; prolong investment periods before seeing returns; all while striving towards economically viable yet environmentally friendly agriculture practices aimed at benefiting both society and personal finances over time.
