17 acres of sandalwood have been planted within a larger 300-acre tract of land. The expected yield per acre after 20 years of growth is projected to be between 1-2 lakhs (100,00Zero to 200,00Zero INR), totaling approximately 37 lakhs (37 million INR) for the plantation. Since planting began 12 years ago, the farm has already seen an income ranging from 65 crores to over 149 crores (65 billion to over 149 billion INR) due to sandalwood cultivation. Agricultural reforms in India in the year 20o2 allowed for wider scale sandalwood farming and led Karnataka state's contribution of abundant seedlings and saplings. These are nurtured primarily in red soil which is conducive to their growth; seedlings can be planted at any time but especially from June through January when they will reach upwards of two feet before needing irrigation or support structures like bamboo stakes during heavy rainfall periods.
The farm operates as both a productive enterprise and an ecological preservation site aiming not just for financial gains but also contributing positively towards conservation efforts globally. Additionally, there seems to be confusion regarding earthmoving equipment usage on these beds, with local practices taking precedence over mechanized methods such as those used by JCB machinery elsewhere. The operation relies heavily on natural processes guided by consistent human oversight spanning multiple generations within this agricultural endeavor that aims to balance economic sustainability with environmental responsibility.
