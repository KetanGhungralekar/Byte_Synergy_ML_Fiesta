The Besaya tree, specifically Srikanth's variety, which can be purchased in Karnataka for approximately 8000 rupees, is noted for its substantial increase in value after 14-15 years. If cultivated and maintained properly without consuming the wood or breaking the gates (which could lead to legal issues), this tree appreciates significantly in value. By the 15th year, a Besaya tree can fetch between 3-4% more than its initial purchase price. After maturing, it yields considerable quantities of produce that range from 20 to 40 kg per unit, depending on conditions and care given during growth. Notably, these trees are becoming scarce due to their high demand; thus they command respect within communities and carry a positive reputation within local societies where they exist. For those interested in investing or obtaining agricultural loans for these profitable ventures over an extended period of around two decades (with the first five years dedicated to establishing the trees followed by another decade of yield enhancement), it's important to seek authorization from local authorities before constructing new structures post-maturation on already developed lands. Full details regarding ownership rights by that time suggest potential opportunities for investment growth with proper agricultural stewardship and adherence to regulatory requirements throughout the development cycle up until harvest commences at around fifty years old when significant profits may be realized from such investments under optimal growing conditions observed so far with matured plants producing valuable crops annually thereafter according to available data collected substantiating this claim based upon empirical evidence gathered across various regions reporting similar experiences with verseera farming practices involving these particular types of flora mentioned above whose characteristics have been accurately summarized herein; further clarification along with answers pertaining to any queries related or unrelated should be addressed directly through comments as instructed by Pawan.Krd who encourages engagement via his educational content provided through video tutorials addressing agroforestry investments including but not limited to Besaya treesâ€™ markets dynamics profitability prospects etc., ending each informative session promptly thanking viewers for their attention support likes shares recommendations feedback willingness towards fostering sustainable agriculture systems benefiting both individuals investors large scale landowners alike ensuring long term viability financial stability environmental conservation cultural heritage preservation community empowerment regional economic contributions overall operational excellence best practice implementation wherever applicable across diverse socioeconomic contexts globally while maintaining ethical standards of integration into existing resource management frameworks currently prevalent worldwide today respected
