The agricultural strategy discussed involves growing grains sustainably over 15 years, with farmers advised to maintain the Aranya method for 12 years. The Aranya model emphasizes careful cultivation and government support, offering financial incentives for planting and maintaining crops. A key aspect of this approach is effective marketing; by reducing costs through efficient practices, such as a 20 rupee cut becoming a 2 rupee purchase after investment in small plants, farmers can significantly increase their income. For instance, planting tomatoes costing 5 rupees can be sold for up to 40 rupees each. Farmers are encouraged to establish Farmers Producing Organizations (FPOs) to improve marketing capabilities due to the popularity of their products. Different types of trees like coconut, lemon, silver, and teak are mentioned as examples of diverse farming strategies suitable for specific terrains—in this case, avoiding excessive tree planting on hilly areas that could damage lower land fertility. Knowledge sharing is highlighted as crucial: understanding what can be grown based on local conditions allows farmers not only to select appropriate species but also to replace or add trees over time without depleting resources—such as transitioning from lesser productive trees such as those already planted towards more profitable options like mangoes when possible within the same ecosystem
