But you said this is a life-saving thing. Is it a joke? That's what I'm saying. Our capacity is not enough. We don't have any labour. We work like a servant. We work like a servant. We work like a servant. We work like a servant. I don't have enough capacity. I work like a servant. Why? Because they come and do something. They don't stay. You don't defend yourself? I don't do my own work. I have 30-35 capacity. I'm a maid. Where do you work? I work around here. I don't go outside. They take my hair and make me a sari. I don't let them take my sari. Do you pass the electricity? No, we don't. We don't do this kind of fencing. I have 800 windbreakers around here. I have 800 windbreakers around here. I have 800 windbreakers around here. If you do solar fencing, it will not come to the ground at 18 feet. If you put windbreakers around the wind, it won't be able to come in the air. It won't dry. That's why I use windbreakers. That's why I use windbreakers. Next to it is a seat-top. That's an anti-virus. One side should be used for other purposes. Is this plant management? This is only half done. This is the process. It's not safe. It's not safe. It's not water. It's not water. It's not water. It's not water. It's not water. It's not water. It's not water. So I have to do it one by one. Next to it is a bed. It also has a nice smell of grass. Then I have the floor. Then I have the water. I have a 100 water-water bath tub. Then I have a bed. I have a 100 beds. No one has done it. Now in our Tulsi time, we are paid 15-20 rupees. Why do I say this? Because nobody does it Then the cost of the dalimba is Rs.2 lakhs per acre. The cost of the petal is Rs.10,000. Even if you lose Rs.30 per kg, you can get the profit. It is coming to us in any way. I don't know why, but I don't want to spend Rs.2 lakhs and get Rs.3 lakhs. I don't want to do anything, I want Rs.2 lakhs. That is natural. I don't want it. I don't want to see the water in the water. I want to show you the water. If you have any doubts, you can ask me. Is this method called Aranya Krishnan method? Yes, this is Aranya Krishnan method. This is natural farming, organic farming, zero budget farming. And there is no investment in zero budget farming. That is what we do. 6 by 6. First I want to show you the water. Then I will show you the water. After that, if you have any doubts, you can clear it. Our children, parents and parents should live in that house.
