The individual recounts a personal financial crisis where, upon waking, they were met with requests for funding from relatives whose mobile phones were inexplicably turned off amidst their boasts of impending victory in gambling activities. The narrator had previously stashed money outside for such emergencies but found themselves in deep despair and dealing with depression due to the constant begging from family members. This prompted introspection about their own life choices and the societal norms they observed, particularly while residing abroad.

Upon returning to his agricultural roots in Karnataka, he became determined to revolutionize farming through sustainable practices by integrating agriculture, agroforestry, and animal husbandry on more than 100 acres of landâ€”beyond mere one-acre plots which he felt were insufficient. He drew on experiences from Dalimbet and sought advice based on Shri Gandhada Bela (also known as Aranya Bela), recognizing its significance beyond being just an option but a critical necessity exemplified by its relevance during the Corona pandemic. His commitment led him to reject traditional criticism against working under harsh conditions at high temperatures without mechanical support or chemicals.
Influenced by Taurvani Darwada's use of Shri Gandhada within Sadhan Keri homes, he delved deeper into understanding this practice based on historical knowledge and nature's principles before engaging with it himself through extensive training in Indian Wood Science Technology (IWST). Despite skepticism towards his methods early on, he persisted guided by intuition rather than external validation..
His innovative approach included implementing Rithu Aadharitha Bela Paddhati ("agricultural systems based on seasons") covering approximately 48 acres using Atthu Guntai methodology achieved across various crop varieties like Shri Gandhada (2500), Maavu (600), Perala (600), Seethapala (450), Betta Nellika/Neerlannu/Hunseannu/Bariyannu/Karibevu each accounting for 109 varieties along with Sagvani Gidha variants amounting up to around 833 enterprises aimed at providing year-round inspiration and support for local farmers throughout diverse seasonal demands.
