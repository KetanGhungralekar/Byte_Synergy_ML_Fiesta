Ananthamba and Amsakshira of Kushti, Koppal district, are second-generation farmers carrying forward their father Devendra Pabbaluti's legacy. He began cultivating dalembe (a legume) since the 1980s on approximately 150 acres and has developed a national reputation for his work. Post the bacterial blight or Dundana Angamari in Dalembe around 2006, they shifted to Srikandha Bile cultivation over 30 acres before expanding it to about 150 acres, which currently constitutes three blocks: Mandal Mariyathara, Madal Gatti, and Narsapura in Kalyanakarnataka's Bilsanadu region of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana border. The brothers aim to participate in tree competitions with superior quality trees while also supplying them across various regions including Hyderabad and parts of Maharashtra. Their approach emphasizes sustainable practices as they converse with birds and trees within their farmlands. The family is deeply rooted in the local culture and environment of Malinadu/Karnataka at Induli village within Indiaâ€™s broader agricultural landscape.
