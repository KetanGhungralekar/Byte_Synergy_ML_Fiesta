Australian sandalwood trees cultivated on our farm are highly valuable, with prices indicating a lucrative agricultural venture. Initially planted in 2001 as part of government-promoted initiatives, private individuals can now plant sandalwood trees on their property; however, resource control remains with the government. Notably, those who plant trees don't need to register them for growth on personal land. Sandalwood requires around 30 years to mature before yielding significant profitsâ€”potentially enriching owners due to high demand and pricing: currently about INR 5 lakh per kilogram of oil (approximately INR 5 crore per tonne), where even half a gram fetches over INR 2 thousand. Initial care is crucial for survival against pests and diseases before reaching maturity when optimal nutrients provide substantial returns within a decade, potentially making farmers millionaires by ensuring financial stability after establishment. It's important to note that young saplings initially require support from host plants until they establish themselves in the soil but will eventually draw nutrients independently once fully grown. Trees harvested at around age ten yield heartwood which accounts for considerable weight despite initial soft wood growth; a tree measuring two feet long can produce approximately seventy to eighty kilograms of heartwood alone, contributing significantly to overall wealth generation upon harvest
