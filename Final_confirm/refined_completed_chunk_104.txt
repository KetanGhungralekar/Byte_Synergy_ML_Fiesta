 In a comprehensive discussion, the speaker emphasized the importance of understanding and confronting challenges like COVID-19, which requires resources such as tablets or injections. They highlighted environmental issues, notably water scarcity in Bangalore and air quality concerns, while expressing aspirations to create and cultivate fragrant forests in Bishul and Bharatan areas using native species adaptable to various conditions. The speaker referred to their familial connection with Sri Gandha through their father's role as Vice President of the National Dalembe Foundation and his involvement with both agricultural associations and politics. Despite facing obstacles like water shortages during the project implementation—a collaboration with Sri Gandha aimed at transforming forest areas—the commitment remains steadfast due to strong beliefs, self-confidence, and dedication towards achieving sustainable results. This initiative is part of an effort to enhance new country's sensory experiences by harnessing nature's potential without relying on borewells for water supply.
