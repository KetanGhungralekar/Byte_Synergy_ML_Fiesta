is always on the bottom of the head, it doesn't damage your drum. Is there any problem with the drum? No, no. In the initial stage, I don't want to play any drum. After five years, I have started playing and I have come to 35. This time I will play 40. So, I will tell you, whatever we play, whatever we do, we are in the game for 1200 rupees. We are in the game for 600 rupees. We are in the game for 300, 200, 200. We have been playing for a long time, we have not played for a long time. We have not played that much. So, if we play this much, what will happen? You will not be able to do anything. You will not be able to do anything. Then you will get more, you will get more and you will get more.

If you go for 5,000 rupees per kg, you get 20 kg of grain per kg. 20 x 5,000 is 1,000,000 rupees per kg. 300 kg per 1 acre is the minimum. 3 crore is the minimum. That is the minimum.
