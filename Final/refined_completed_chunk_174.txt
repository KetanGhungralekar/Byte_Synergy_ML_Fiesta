 Nortari News 8 recently featured a segment in Kannada discussing the Jalanamadu and Balanimadu projects. A significant part of the discussion focused on an ongoing operation involving a structure with multiple access points designed to trap illegal activities. If disturbed, the structure would collapse into an underground concealed space. The operation requires careful planning, including determining the thickness of materials if cutting is necessary; currently, everything looks entirely black from above, similar to a diamond.
The segment also touched upon financial aspects where immediate approval leads to an advance payment of 20%, followed by final settlement after one month when the material dries upâ€”a process that has been going on for seven years without interruption despite some confusion over time frames (initially described as both two and seven years).

In another context during this period, approximately 7 acres were planted out of which around 2 acres are being discussed specifically. There is also mention of an incidentally reported planting on the ninth floor covering about 9 acres at a different location. The total extent under consideration spans roughly 800 aces or equivalently eight crores INR in value based on initial discussions before clarification indicating that only one project area measuring exactly 30 acres belongs to Srikandha and its worth stands corrected at nine billion rupees (90 crores INR), not one lakh Srikandha as previously mentioned due to differing perspectives between parties involved in evaluating land usage; this particular area houses Sisters' quarters accommodating approximately nine thousand women dedicated solely to their tasks within these confines without any cultivation presence nearby.
