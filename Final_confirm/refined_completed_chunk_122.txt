22-year-old Pavitra Jain introduces a young farmer from Yadagiri, who has been actively involved in agriculture for 22 years. This farmer, now managing an 18-acre farm with his family—including his brother and parents—previously pursued IT education but found true passion in farming after discovering its potential through the 'freedom app.' He credits his success to valuable insights gained from educational content on topics like dragon fruit cultivation, paper plate techniques, Sree Gandha's bagina methods, and Dalimbe practices. The farmer subscribed to the service at its outset and diligently watches courses to stay informed and enhance his farming knowledge. His story emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in modern agriculture.
