To optimize the growth of heartwood and oil content in trees, sufficient light and oxygen are essential, while excessive watering can inhibit heartwood development and reduce oil quality. For hosting Srikanda plants, it's crucial to maintain an optimal water content that is not excessively high; Malayashrita's plant is particularly suitable as a host due to its moderate water requirements. Planting Srikanda requires careful consideration of space—5 feet should be allocated for both the host plant and Srikanda to ensure proper nutrient and water exchange without hindering growth. In practice, a garden example shows that maintaining this distance ensures healthy tree growth if the host plant is within 5 feet of Srikandra.
The wider adaptability crop mentioned refers to certain trees capable of thriving in diverse environments when given 10 feet of space each, allowing up to 160 such trees per acre. These mature trees have been cultivated for 15-20 years yielding approximately 20 kg of hardwood each. At current market rates in India (Rs. 6,000 per tree), one mature tree can fetch Rs. 6,000 but when considering harvest from all trees planted (up to Rs. 1,248 million or $17 million from selling just the wood alone). Intercropping options like papaya, lemon, cardamom, cinnamon can be incorporated among these trees for additional income sources since they require protection against pests due to lower yields relative to demand – prompting government support through projects like "Grow More Sandalwood." In Karnataka specifically, measures include using microchips provided by Indian Wood Science and Technology as part of their protection system against theft or damage caused by external factors like boulders falling onto the trunk during landslides/earthquakes etc., which helps safeguard this valuable resource with significant economic potential on farmlands throughout India's agricultural sector annually contributing millions into our national economy every year .
