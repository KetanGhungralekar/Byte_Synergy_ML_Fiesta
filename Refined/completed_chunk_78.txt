You should come one step ahead. And regarding protection aspect, I am telling about the E-protection system. What is E-protection system? We are putting microchip in the middle. This is operated through sensors. There is no wire like this. Where do the signals come from? Then what we do for this is we have to connect the world. For that we are connecting four gateways through routers. Modern it interacts with only one device. Whereas router interacts with multi devices. One of this connection will be given to IWST server. What is IWST? Indian Wood Science Technology. Indian Wood Science Society. They are doing all your trees' research. They give you a drone in this system. In that you have day vision camera and dark vision cameras. In day vision, whoever comes to you, they will tell you that it is night time. Everyone has a light, bright screen. For that, dark vision camera is working. Any image that comes from anywhere, it will be automatically altered. It will capture black and white image and go to IWST. It can be human or it can be animal. Then they will give you name plate. One, two, three, four. If you give these 100 and it is over, very immediate alert message will come. This is mobile. It is the nearest police station. You are not in your village. The building is already demolished. But because of that chip, it will show the location exactly where your wood is moving in which direction. So now you are risk free. But now, we have to pay 2000 rupees for this. For one year, they will pay 2000 rupees and return it once they build the building. They will keep the money for the shopping. They will give all the stuff. We have to pay 100 rupees per month. 24 to 27 they are working for us. So this is E-protection. They will come here. So now I am asking the government to give us the cost of building. So what I am saying is, you have to take the biggest amount. It is because of the water, the amount of water is more. If it is more, they will increase the cost. What is this madam? They will increase the cost of water. But actually, we don't need water. Sir, we have to reduce the water. From the initial stage, the cost of the building is increased. We are reducing the water. We don't need water. We don't need water. Why should we increase the cost? We should increase the cost of water. But if we increase the water, we won't get water. We should not increase the cost. We should not increase the cost scientifically or technically. We should not increase the cost. We should not increase the cost. But at the end of 12 to 15 years, your auntie's children should go and see. Because if they say, I am going to be a great auntie, everyone will not beWe've planted a big seed.
