8 acres of land in Rayachur district, including 2 acres of cultivable land, 1 acre of soil, and various fields such as 600 paddy fields, 600 seed fields (presumably for paddy), 300 water bodies, 150 cucumber beds, and mixed coconut groves totaling approximately an additional half-acre. The farm also features rice fields amounting to around another quarter-acre. Owner Kavitha Mishra is a sandalwood farmer with innovative agricultural methods she wishes to share through her YouTube channel 'Kalamadhyama.' For over a decade, local farmers have been trying to relocate trees known as Sri Gandha from Aranya forest to Kallarapal forest due to unclear reasons or possibly illegitimate activities like cutting down those very trees at night despite the risk posed by their heavy machinery use without proper marketing knowledge which led initially not just wasting time but ultimately damaging their long term prospects. Police intervention is required to ensure these precious trees are planted appropriately in the designated area for the safety and sustainability of both nature and farming practices.
