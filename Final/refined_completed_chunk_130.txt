Ramesh Balutti, a resident of Dalimbe village in Koppal district, Karnataka, shares his insights on the plight of farmers and efforts to preserve Srikandabelta's Sandalwood industry. He highlights that within 45-50 years, a farmer may not afford to own a house or earn a salary of INR 1 lakh due to low remunerationâ€”only INR 2000 per hand if rates are favorable. Ramesh emphasizes the challenges faced by farmers who must migrate and work under harsh conditions. He advocates for community support and resilience as key factors in overcoming these obstacles. His initiative involves experimenting with farming practices at his parents' home in Dalimbe before potentially expanding to other locations like Srikandabelta, aiming to protect Sandalwood groves (Srikanda) and promote economic growth through sustainable methods across Karnataka. Ramesh has been actively involved in raising awareness about the importance of Sandalwood which is known by various names such as Chandana (Hindi) and scientifically as Santali Album or Santali Spicigera (English). In conclusion, Ramesh calls upon local communities and policymakers to enhance measures for protecting this valuable resource while also addressing the welfare of those whose livelihoods depend on it.
