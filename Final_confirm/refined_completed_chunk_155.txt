 The paragraph discusses the challenges and considerations for securing a border with an emphasis on the reliability of RFID chips for tracking intrusions. It highlights several issues, including:
- A warning against relying solely on alarms or completed walls for security; metaphorically, it suggests that if one places a stick in their eye (a error) and then embeds it in a wall (implementing the mistake), it won't resolve the issue.
- Concerns about the reliability of chips; closing one's eyes and placing a chip in a wall would result in losing track of it entirely.
- Deception by some companies from Mysore who offer free services like fencing and chipping over extended periods but fail to deliver authentic solutionsâ€”these firms are described as fraudulent.
- The cost of installation ranges from 5 to 8 Lakh Rupees per acre, with additional expenses such as changing batteries every three years at approximately 50 to 70 rupees each, unless using similar cells that might not provide complete longevity due to prototype limitations which could keep units offline for at least one to two years minimum.
- To address security concerns effectively, multiple measures are recommended: installing barbed wire or electric wires along borders, deploying guard dogs, and setting up advanced alarm systems incorporating point sensors connected to sound alerts when movement is detected during nighttime hours.
- The speaker encourages viewers to take full responsibility for their land's security rather than entrusting others who may not be sincere or legitimate agents capable of providing sufficient protection. They emphasize educating oneself before making decisions regarding security investments related to farmlands or other properties valued both financially and sentimentally.
