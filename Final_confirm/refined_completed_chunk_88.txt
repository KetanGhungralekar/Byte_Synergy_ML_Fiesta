25,100 Lakh farmers in the Bidar district of India, facing drought-like conditions annually, have found hope through the innovative farming techniques of farmer Jaffer Meea. Despite skepticism and financial challenges, including receiving a government salary cut due to ongoing reforms, Jaffer invested ₹16,000 in seedlings which revolutionized his approach to agriculture on his 10 acres of stone slab land. His efforts paid off as he successfully cultivated crops like watermelons and implemented crop rotation with vegetables like cucumbers (besay). These practices not only diversified produce but also led to better yields despite initial limitations. Srigandha from the forest region joined Jaffer's initiative using honey water for irrigation and leveraging other resources such as tractors and power tillers for efficient farm management. The result is an increase in agricultural production among local farmers including Maaza Papai Sita Pala who are now able to grow various crops thanks to support from initiatives like those spearheaded by Jaffer Meea. This progress has caught the attention of global experts aiming to enhance agricultural knowledge with insights from Israeli technology while ensuring sustainable cultivation through proper storage facilities for harvested goods.
