The paragraph describes an analysis of forest conditions, focusing on the frequency of certain types of incidents occurring within a diverse range of forests. Specifically, there is mention of two key statistics regarding 'incidents': firstly, it states that "in nine out ten plots" these events occur; and secondly, citing a study involving 129 such instances across various European forests over seven years (with approximately equal representation from deciduous broadleaved and coniferous dominant habitats), only a small number (a fraction) exhibit this phenomenon. The data suggests that while the incident rate is significant in most cases, its prevalence remains limited overall.
