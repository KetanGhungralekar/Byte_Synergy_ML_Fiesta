Srikandha farmers are mandating an annual payment of varying amounts between 4 and 16 lakhs (4-16 million rupees) to maintain their agricultural activities. This is set within the context of Kattu-Gudu forest land, with additional costs for building infrastructure amounting to up to 30 lakhs per year. The region in question spans a total of 40 acres and has been traditionally cultivated with significant yields; over 16 years in one acre of Sridharaya Alladagi, crops worth approximately 3 crores were produced annually before being expanded into ten acres for commercial sale in Srikandha, yielding profits exceeding 35 crores across similar time frames. Government support has been noted as providing one crop every three years at a rate of Rs.3 per year to both Srikandha and another area named Sitaplu, along with assistance provided directly to construction workers involved in local projects. The contributions made by Sanjithi TV and others towards supporting farmers have been acknowledged as valuable acknowledgment received from viewers outside the immediate farming community who have shown willingness to contribute positively through various channels such as news outlets or personal interventions.
