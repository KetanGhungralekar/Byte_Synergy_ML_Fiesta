 Farmers in the Bedar district's Aura taluk are embarking on a new generational initiative by cultivating trees of Sri Gandha, which have matured for 10-15 years. These trees are being propagated in the Aranya forest area. The sustainable practices employed suggest that this endeavor could potentially be stone-free, as evidenced by the existing growth. This project not only aims to continue the legacy but also introduces an innovative approach to agriculture within these villages, with local farmers actively participating in planting and nurturing these trees for future generations.
