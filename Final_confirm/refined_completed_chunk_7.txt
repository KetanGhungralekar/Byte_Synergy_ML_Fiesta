The current agricultural scenario faces significant challenges, including the rise of processed food consumption due to industrialization. This shift has led to soil pollution and a decrease in its moisture retention capacity, exacerbating evaporation and environmental degradation. Modern farming practices post-1960s, often referred to as 'gondola agriculture,' rely heavily on chemicals with uncertain compositions; both farmers and government authorities are frequently unaware of which specific insecticides or fungicides are used. Consequently, there is a lack of understanding about the benefits versus the potential long-term harm these chemicals can cause. The dependency on external markets makes it difficult for farmers to control prices or demand fair compensation for their produce.
Key statistics highlight that if one crop plant is introduced over 100 acres, 90% of the land could be considered unused due to suboptimal cultivation techniques. This critical issue necessitates immediate action because conventional farming methods are increasingly unsustainable and harmful both economically and environmentally. There's an urgent need for comprehensive analysis by governments or jobless individuals regarding chemical usage in agricultureâ€”including NPK fertilizers, micro nutrients, stimulants (insecticides/pesticides), and evaluating Maximum Residue Limits (MRL). For instance, certain drugs like Proclame or Carbon Degene when sprayed today must not appear in harvested crops brought to market tomorrow under MRL regulations; yet without proper monitoring this guideline may be violated as recently applied chemicals might still be present within a set period before they can safely dissipate from produce intended for human consumption (e.g., Methomil has a 20-day wait but cannot be consumed by humans for another 90 days). Addressing these concerns is crucial for preserving our ecosystem while ensuring safe consumer products free from excess chemical residues.
