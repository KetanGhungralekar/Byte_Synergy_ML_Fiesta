9 crores (approx. $120 million) was initially mentioned as a significant financial figure, but it's clarified that an amount far greater than this is available for building a visionary project—a forest in Bishil Nadu (now referred to as Bharad Nadu). The speaker expresses their desire to transform into a forest itself, envisioning the space filled with life and educational opportunities. The area already hosts over 500 benign trees, which are part of an ecosystem supporting various species and facilitating natural regeneration. Despite initial estimates suggesting around 1 lakh crores (approx.$13 billion), the actual cost needed might be less than 9 crores due to organic processes contributing to tree growth without human intervention. The site shows evidence of advanced ecological dynamics with approximately 15,000 mature trees among the total flora count of about 1 lakh trees or more, including plenty of Azadirecta indica—India's national tree—which naturally regenerates within the area. This thriving habitat also has plants capable of forming entire ecosystems and could potentially inspire extensive scientific research or even lead to multiple PhD dissertations. Additionally, there are underground traps designed at depths up to 10 feet reachable only by lifting weights exceeding common limits set out in safety guidelines for such tasks; these features highlight the meticulous planning invested in maintaining this unique environmentally protected landscape..
