The speaker reflects on their experience with landscape management, noting the interplay between human labor and natural processes. They express uncertainty about whether humans shaped the land or vice versa, emphasizing a method of patience and observation. The land is used for timber production but its true power remains mysterious to the speaker. They observe the growth of grass through "natural pruning," explaining it as part of secondary metabolism unaffected by soil composition, which they've demonstrated by planting sand that led to successful sprouting from an IAS (Indian Agricultural Service) approved seed variety after 1000 years; within a decade, this seed multiplied over a thousandfold. The IAS seeds have been tested and proven to pass examinations physically and on surfaces.
The speaker then shifts to discuss sandalwood trees growing naturally due to birds' droppings, highlighting their resilience over historical periods such as half a millennium affected by events like pandemics like coronaâ€”likely referring metaphorically to challenges faced in cultivation or reforestation efforts spanning centuries rather than two recent years of COVID-19 pandemic disruption. Throughout the narrative, there is an emphasis on staying present and attentive while working with nature's rhythms instead of against them for sustainable outcomes in agriculture or forestry practices.
