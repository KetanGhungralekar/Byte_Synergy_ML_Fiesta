 In a heartfelt plea, a farmer seeks forgiveness from the trees for his actions that led to their destruction. He acknowledges receiving water, firewood, and corn from them but admits that he failed to protect them from being killed by fire. He expresses his intention to burn the trees himself as penance and asks the tree spirit to forgive him for his past mistakes. The farmer commits to planting trees like his father did and concludes with traditional greetings before delving into agricultural issues in India.
Dr. Sivanan of Aranya Mahavidyala addressed concerns at Kishanwarthi.com regarding the cultivation of Srikandas (Sterculia urens), a plant native to India facing protection challenges due to vandalism involving stone-throwing incidents. Dr. Sivanan clarified misconceptions about restrictions on growing this species; he stated there are no specific permissions required for its cultivation and encouraged farmers not to fear these constraints based on incorrect information spread among them.

At Kishanwarthi.com, Dr. Sivanan presented two lectures highlighting crucial differences between 'plants' referred colloquially and botanical varieties/species—distinguishing between sterile hybrids called "khichdi" plants without genetic variability ('no plant') versus true diversified species like Srikanda which exhibit distinct smells indicative of their genetics, even though it is typically associated with only one type of smell—the characteristic stench common among Sterculia species planted throughout Kerala over more than 20 years since 2050 when permission was granted by authorities including police officials who would otherwise require permits for other large-scale plantations or constructions violating land use norms intended primarily as conservation measures against ecological degradation caused by reckless human activities
