10 years post-plantation, a security system has been established to protect the plants. The expected timeline for financial return is 5 years after planting with an additional investment of 3 years until seeds are planted. These plants will require maintenance for approximately 3-4 years post-seeding before they mature enough to produce oil that fetches good ratesâ€”estimated at INR 2000 per liter which is suitable for massages. After four years, proper care and watering have yielded positive growth results despite initial issues like broken covers leading to damaged plants. The nursery initiated by individuals in Bangalore was maintained properly without external funding, resulting in healthy stock development. Initially, investments were made at around INR 100-200 per plant without any immediate monetary gain but with potential long-term benefits once fully grown and producing the desired output.
