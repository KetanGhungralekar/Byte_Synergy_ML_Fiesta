In the 1980s, the area surrounding the university was home to numerous smell trees. A professor who joined the campus in 1983 recalls a constant aroma associated with these trees. However, since then, significant efforts have been made to address this issue; notably, prioritizing non-smelly tree planting and maintaining an abundance of greenery visible from aboveâ€”there are so many trees it's evident as a university priority. Despite these efforts, there has been some regression: certain high-priority but nonetheless fragrant trees were planted which led to a noticeable foul odor on campus that has intensified over time due to their decomposition after being cut down daily for what is described as 'black milk,' likely a local name for tea or coffee produced at the university farm. The groves alongside roads and remaining smaller trees within unnamed spaces show signs of complete desiccation once left untouched for upwards of two weeks before being processed into simpler forms and removed entirely. This process generates such an intense stench from deceased foliage that it deters visitors even without direct inquiry about air quality near forests where similar decay occurs more conspicuously during mechanical felling operations with machines capable of cutting down heavy wood within seconds without human intervention needed nearby due to safety concerns or legal ramifications involved if public interest takes action against perceived environmental harm despite no official record indicating precedented damage since recent decades when new reforestation initiatives began by committees tasked with management of these natural resources
