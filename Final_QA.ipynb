It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

But between the beautiful flowers there is a thorn. What this thorn does is it is used as a fence. If someone is cleaning the fence it is used as a natural fence. This is a hybrid. It is 70 rupees per kg. It is a profit. If you have a bird or a bird's nest you can use it as a fence. But look at the aesthetics. If you want this body and want to know more about the number subscribe to our channel. This is a single tree. This is a fence. This is a fruit tree. It is a profit.\n",
