The government is promoting various schemes aimed at supporting farmers.

There's a growing concern over youth suicide rates linked to societal pressures for wealth and status. Suresh Babantha operates a Greenwood farm in Kolaru, Karnataka, situated about 68 km from Bangalore near the KMF dairy. The farm integrates multiple sustainable practices including poultry, aquaculture, crop cultivation (both traditional and kitchen gardens), medicinal plant cultivation, horticulture as well as agritourism opportunities. It serves as an educational hub where local farmers are trained biweekly on site; they must understand at least half of the farm operations through direct interaction rather than just theoretical knowledge presented via audiovisuals. This approach emphasizes practical learning based on real-world examples of profitable ventures within the ecosystem of Greenwood Farm. Mr. Babantha invites particularly those young individuals who have relinquished ancestral properties or pursued education like SLC/PUC but then turned to urban farming endeavors without much success after a decade or more to consider joining his program where they could learn viable equitable farming techniques that promise a better financial future despite initial moderate investments required for setting up their own similar venture post training completion at his facility in Karnataka State Agricultural University campus coimbatore Tamil Nadu India Asia Pacific International dating websites uk microsites scripts softwareâ€¦
