 A comprehensive plan for cultivating a specific plant species that is expected to mature and yield benefits over a period of 5-10 years has been outlined. The plant, similar in aroma to Srikandha and identified from its characteristics, will begin production after approximately 3-4 years post-seeding. Initial investment into the nursery setup with seed planting is anticipated within the first three years, leading to maintenance costs during this initial phase. By year four, the plants are projected to grow significantly and start providing oil which fetches good market rates (approximately INR 2000 per liter). Regular care including watering every 5-6 days has proven effective in nurturing the plants' growth despite some early setbacks due to improper handling or environmental factors. Investment in maintaining the facility has been recognized as crucial for success, while acknowledging certain operational challenges such as ensuring proper care and monitoring within the nursey environment. The individual involved resides in Bangalore and initially paid around INR 100-200 for each plant purchased from a nursery without any financial support during their development stage.
