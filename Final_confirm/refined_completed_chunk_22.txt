 Over three years, including two years of active planting and one year of observation, I have successfully planted 300 trees across 3 acres. The first plot has matured over two years, while the second plot is currently in its inaugural growing season. The tree species in question is Srikandha, a type known for its adaptability to various conditions. Despite being originated from Sri Lanka, Srikandha can thrive under different caste systems—a testament to its resilience across diverse climates and soils globally. In Canada (the example provided), where the soil may differ significantly from that of Sri Lanka or India's Godharan/Mallinayak regions, the growth rate can exceed 20% due to favorable environmental factors such as soil quality and climate suitability.
The water management strategy for Srikandha involves irrigating the trees every seven years initially; after establishment, manual irrigation alternates with natural moisture every other day for an hour consecutively during dry periods. For disease management, a gold-based paste applied once annually into small holes made near the base of each tree serves as a medicinal treatment without requiring additional medications.
