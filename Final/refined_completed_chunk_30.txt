 The African Blackwood, a powerful tree species valued both for its timber and cultural significance, stands tall between 20 to 40 feet. Native to 26 countries in Central and South Africa, this evergreen species can last up to 60 years in the wild. Regarded as an important resource, it is prized internationally; with prices reaching upwards of Â£8,000 per kg or approximately 7 lakh rupees (about $935 USD at current exchange rates). However, due to overexploitation particularly in Kenya and Tanzania where the wood is believed to enhance strength and power when used musically or crafted into weapons, the African Blackwood faces threats from illegal harvesting. Despite its potential for creating instruments like guitars and its use in traditional medicine, conservation efforts are crucial for preserving this unique tree that has existed on Earth for millions of years. Currently within Sir Mukundra's family property along his late father's land legacy left by his elder brother Kanhailu who dedicated considerable effort towards cultivating it sustainably with dimensions ideally measuring around 10x10 meters but currently not quite meeting that standard due to space constraints yet still providing adequate growth conditions supported by regular watering which mitigates stress during hot seasons. Their strategy involves managing about half a hectare with roughly 500 plants under a long-term plan known as Sadhyakantra Dalambari Banana initiative aimed at sustainable development over two decades while optimistically maintaining production levels based on market demands aiming for favorable returns despite the present low pricing structure.
