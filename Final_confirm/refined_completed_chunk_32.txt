The discussion revolves around the cultivation and economic value of Kempu moon (also known as blood moon or red sandalwood), which is one of the most common trees in India. This tree, scientifically referred to as Pterocarpus santalinus, grows up to 5-8 meters with a notably broad canopy. It's highly valued internationally for its lexis branches used in making musical instruments. The wood from this species has significant demand due to its voluminous nature; however, it should not be confused with sacred Indian sandalwood (Santalum album). Kempu moon thrives well in dry and arid conditions and can survive on less water compared to other types of trees. In terms of yield, each mature tree produces approximately 500 kg of heartwood over a span of ten years after being transplanted into 10 by 10 feet plots following two initial years of nursery care. To maximize growth, saplings are planted during May-June after proper soil preparationâ€”removing existing vegetation within a radius of 4-4 meters at depths between 45-90 cm before planting new rootstocks that measure about 3 mm thickness. Blood moon smuggling was once prevalent but has been curbed significantly owing to regulations and conservation efforts ensuring sustainability in harvesting these valuable plants while maintaining their natural abundance in forests across India.
