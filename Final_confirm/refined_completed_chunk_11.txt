Old police officer Sundar is commended for his diligent work and the efforts of his son, Abha Vishwa, who played a pivotal role in the Kempammana court case. Abha Vishwa, although referred to as a small boy despite being 6 feet 2 inches tall and an accomplished actor, directed a short film titled "Reckoning." This film was supported by Udda, who is younger than the speaker and had previously sought advice on dance and recording from Chowdaya Memorial. Notably, Sanjay Shantaram, known for his role in Swami Ayyappa films such as "Ayyappa Swami" and "Manne Kempe Gowda," also featured in "Reckoning."
The speaker has another disciple named Vivekanth Bagalkoti, also a software engineer like Abha Vishwa; he is directing a movie called "Kushmanda Roopa," where he stars either as one of the leads or an anti-hero. The production of this film employed many people over two days with the narrator providing story suggestions but refraining from telling it all at once. Additionally, there seems to have been discussion about historical water searching at Chandanavanna Fort during their interactions related to these projects.
