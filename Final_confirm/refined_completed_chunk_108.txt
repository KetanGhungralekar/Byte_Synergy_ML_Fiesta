GS Kamthar, a resident of Bijapur with 16 years of experience in the field, explains the complexities and corruption inherent in the process where locals must obtain permits from officials who often demand bribes or "gifts." The officers have a monopoly, requiring even a single small gift to expedite permit processing. Kamthar recounts his personal experience receiving thousands of gifts from birds over a year but emphasizes that this shouldn't necessitate human bribery. He argues that authorities should provide legitimate permits instead of demanding gifts for extended working hours. This issue is deeply rooted in industrial laws and has impacted numerous farmers sacrified for factory operations.
Kamthar advocates for an alternative system where middlemen and exploitive practices are eliminated; companies should offer fair rates directly to farmers while ensuring prompt payments during construction phases, avoiding unnecessary hardships like sleeping outside factories or offices. He suggests that these disputes have been raised multiple times with policymakers but remain unresolved as evidenced by their persistent queries when meeting influential ministersâ€”over 2000 times according to him. Despite occasional hiccups, he insists that the current system generally functions smoothly once proper procedures are followed without resorting to illegal means nor facing political repercussions such as imprisonment due to resistance against corrupt chains within the bureaucracy. Throughout his discourse, Kamthar stresses transparency and integrity in government-induced transactions.
