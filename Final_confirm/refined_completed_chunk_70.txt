Dr. P.K. Praveen Babu, an Ayurveda and Marama scholar, addresses his audience daily at 9 am through yoga videos on his channel which also covers Ayurveda Panchakarma practices. He emphasizes the importance of understanding Shrikandha, a herbal substance with significant religious significance in their pooja rituals due to its association with living in the forest as per Lord's attributes. Dr. Babu clarifies that Shrikandha itself should not be used but rather its component Dravya which imparts strength and vitality to the body when smelled; it is not about applying Shrikandha directly but harnessing its essence through aromatic means for therapeutic benefits.
He recommends incorporating holy water infused with Shrikaanth power into bathing rituals or placing a holy stone in temple water overnight before washing one's face amidst skin concerns like wrinkles and dark circles, which they have observed improving from this practice during their clinical experienceâ€”excluding any form of partial pranayama related to chemical exfoliation processes that might worsen skin conditions if performed incorrectly.
