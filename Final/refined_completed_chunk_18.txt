The message is a call to action for individuals, particularly Christine designers in the area, to support a group of farmers from Chidurga district during an uncertain situation involving potential opposition and legal disputes, reminiscent of their advocacy for Haddangas. The farmers are requesting immediate assistance due to an ongoing issue where they might face harassment or interference from a truck following themâ€”a matter they wish to address on social media. They emphasize the urgency to unite against this challenge. In addition, these farmers currently residing in Cam SUS are asking visitors and supporters alike to come see their land firsthand during the month of July when they plan to plant 5 acres (with variations suggesting half-acre plans). Despite facing hardship and requiring support, these individuals remain determined and hopeful that organizations like WorldTC will back them. They also express concern over deforestation issues comparing it with what has happened in Srikandha village. The message concludes with questioning if any genuine music was found similar by Kishida or other artists as per someone's claim related to establishing facts within their community context.
