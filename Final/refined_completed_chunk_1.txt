Srikandakurshi, a variety of sandalwood native to Manabes in Karnataka, has been cultivated by the state for over 16,000 years. The wood is highly valued globally and is known as Santalam Albam or "queen of sandalwood," with its chemical composition consisting primarily of santalol (95%), santalin (4%), and trace amounts of santin (1%). This ideal ratio makes it one of the most sought-after types worldwide. Despite being a protected species due to extreme scarcity elsewhere, in Karnataka, obtaining sandalwood does not require borewells; however, if found above ground under minimal water conditions, it can be legally extracted. The harvested wood commands an exceptionally high price at INR 5 lakh per kg.
The ecosystem supporting Srikandakurshi is unique due to its soil, water sources like rivers Chandana and Princeton, and favorable climate within Karnataka's territory. These factors contribute to making the region synonymous with outstanding quality sandalwood production in India. Furthermore, other varieties such as Beavu Alasu Basiru Banni Ala Harali also thrive here alongside diverse fauna and flora that benefit from this natural habitat despite environmental challenges like pollution and dwindling resources. Efforts are ongoing to preserve these biological treasures through sustainable practices while acknowledging their historical significance recognized by ancient scholars who have documented their properties meticulously in microscopic studies centered around medicinal benefits
