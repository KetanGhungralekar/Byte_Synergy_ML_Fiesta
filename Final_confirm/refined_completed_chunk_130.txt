 Ramesh Balutti, a resident of Kushtiya in Koppal district and a native of Dalimbe village, has been vocal about the challenges faced by farmers who may not afford to buy houses or earn enough salaries due to declining agricultural profitability. This issue led him to advocate for fair compensation for laborers, with rates ranging from Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000 per day depending on whether they receive their due rate or not. Ramesh has previously worked as an assistant accountant and is currently involved in an initiative aiming to protect Srikandabelta from diseases and integrate Sandalwood cultivation across various regions including India and abroad (such as Australia, Indonesia, Thailand). He emphasizes the importance of preserving this valuable industry that contributes both economically and culturally through products known as Chandana (Hindi) or Sandal Album/Sandal SC in English. His efforts include organizing campaigns like "Save Srikanthadri" which saw over 2896 entries during its launch phase last year. Through his work, he aims to support local farmers greatly impacted by these economic pressures while promoting sustainable practices within the sandalwood trade sector in Karnataka.

Key statistics:
- Farmer income concerns with some potentially earning less than INR 1 lakh annually.
- Daily wage rates for laborers between INR 2000 - INR 3547 based on if they receive their deserved pay or not (assuming higher end rate mentioned earlier corresponds reasonably well with daily wages after negotiations).
- Over 2896 participants joined the "Save Srikanthadri" campaign at its initial stage; note that this number refers specifically to entries made into something related but requires further clarification regarding its context exactly when launched was undefined ("August"). Precise data might refer participation milestones reached thus far since initiation without conflating it with monthly figures unless stated otherwise explicitly
