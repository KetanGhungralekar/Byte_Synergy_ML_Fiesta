In my vision, possessing a 'dream visa' would enable sustained engagement with local farmers through permanent contacts and weekly group discussions every Monday and Tuesday at 9 am. These gatherings are aimed at addressing farming challenges, sharing agricultural practices, and providing free food to participants. With 4 acres of land secured from the dream visa, I plan to dedicate 1 acre for traditional agriculture, while leveraging the remaining 3 acres for seed production. This diversified approach will also include oil farming on an additional acre acquired by adding Shrikhandha flour (including crops like Karebeo, Perla, Kharabew etc.), as well as vegetable and floriculture operations. The initiative aims to achieve substantial produce; in Munnoor village alone, we anticipate wheat yields reaching upwards of 500 quintals – equivalent to producing "Medyan" quantity or around Rs.10 lakhs worth (assuming each grain weighs approx. 1 kg). By the fifteenth year of cultivation with optimal conditions (such as a consistent moisture level of approximately 3-4%), this could potentially generate more than Rs.3 crores per year based on market prices for high-value crops like butter fruits or Nellai varieties without reliance on external imports or purchasing food supplies for pets due to self-sufficiency in our products via live fencing strategies combined with windbreakers over an extended period of about fifteen years at an estimated cost of Rs.3 crores investment initially leading up to building a white house within that time frame worth Rupees one crore intended for prosperous family living conditions and happiness fulfillment for generations — all within reach if we invest half that amount now under the guidance of state bank support systems post ten years when CCTV surveillance becomes feasible alongside other security measures ensuring safety against theft or loss equivalent value returned in terms asset appreciation equating gold reserves increase by one kilogram level upon such investments made wisely today toward our collective dreams tomorrow
