coconut is too much, the water will not flow. If it is too much, the water will flow. If it rains, we don't turn on the motor. If it doesn't rain, we water it with water. How much time can you water it? We water it daily. We water it daily. We water it daily. We water it daily. How long do you water it if you don't use coconut? We water it once a year. Coconut? Yes. Is it enough? No, no. Once a year, we water it in half a pot and water it with mud. Okay, okay. If we want to get a good harvest, what do we have to do? We have to mix some water and mix it. If we don't get a good harvest, we can add some coconut water. We can see the water. How many acres of water did you water? We watered 750 acres. How many acres? 2 acres. Did you leave a gap for the whole 2 acres? No, we left everything. Everything is perfect. Did you manage to manage all the 2 acres? Yes, we had a little water problem. So we left the gap. We have filled the water tank and filled the front. We filled the front with 800 acres of mud. We have leveled the water level. Water will not become a problem. If it rains, it will not become a problem. How long will this stay on the top? More than 15 years. More than 15 years. If we look at it properly, it will be 1.25 crore rupees. If we want to see this rate, it is here. At any time, there is a star. Tomatoes came, the price went. That's why tomatoes came. There is a problem everywhere and the price is there. Now it is changing by 100-100 kms. Pusles came. When there is no pusle, there is a demand. There is a little demand. What is the use for that? It is a little. It is not a little. For the farmers. It is like that. Otherwise, we have said that we can't do anything. We have said that we can't do anything. We can't change. It was a loss of 40,000 rupees. We said that we can't change. We took oil from it. We changed the oil. Then we put it in the mills in India. We did this. Then it was legalized. In that way, the farmers can't grow any seeds. Because they have to be brave, put seeds and stay. If I want to come, I can't come. I have to stay. Now we are not Gandhari or Sri Gandhari. Now we are not Kadalena or Kadupon. That is a criminal case. You are your own seed. What is the problem now? I am making a bus for this. I will make a 20 feet compound. I will not let anyone in. Today it is closed. Today it is closed. Tomorrow the oil will start. We will seethat time and make the compound.
