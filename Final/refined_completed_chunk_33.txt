The Kempu Chandana, historically significant and crucial for the health of Shrikhandi trees, particularly affects their growth between April and May when its leaves are consumed by boys. These trees require frequent application of Manu Crotophage, twice weekly to manage this issue effectively. Kempu Chandana stunts the growth of Shrikhandis significantly; thus, a large number (upwards of tens) of these trees must be cultivated if proper-sized specimens are desired. The tree itself can reach 150 to 175 cm in height naturally but can attain up to 9 meters with additional care over three years. However, it is sensitive to high temperatures and cannot thrive in such conditions without protection.
Historically used as a medicinal plant both in alcoholic and liquid forms, including for musical instruments due to its importance in promoting tree growth through beneficial chemical properties or possibly other unspecified reasons related to music's influence on well-being. The financial implications for farmers who grow Kempu Chandana are substantial; after investing around INR 20-30 lakh (2 - 3 million rupees) per hectare over ten years with optimal weather conditions, they can potentially earn upwards of INR 10 crores (1 billion rupees), even reaching INR 25 crores (2.5 billion rupees). Water scarcity limits the usable period for these plants to about 10-15 days during certain periods before rehydration becomes necessary again. Despite potential earnings from crop sales being significantâ€”with roughly one liter earning around INR 200--farmers face risks that could lead them into debt equivalent to approximately an Indian crore depending on market demand and climatic factors like rainfall which greatly affect yields accordingly similar pattern as losses resulted from working under stress against shortages . They struggle especially because they often have no choice but sell off their land despite the lucrative nature of crops like Kempu Chandana due obsolete agricultural practices causing loss over time rather than profit unless exceptional efforts were made consistently across multiple seasons which isn't guaranteed given environmental constraints such as temperature sensitivity mentioned earlier dms visits Malvali Talukku Rithanapuram relaying concerns raised by Munir Reddy regarding farmer economic hardships leading some inevitably affected individuals towards indebtedness at staggering sums while highlighting a pressing need for
