A young man named Ajay, aged 22, from Sriganad Mara, has set a goal to empower students and contribute positively to the agricultural sector. He emphasizes the importance of agriculture not just on a state level but as a potential avenue for personal enterprise. To aid aspiring agriculturists like himself, Ajay suggests utilizing educational resources such as downloading the Freedom App and enrolling in relevant agricultural courses. His dedication to education and innovation in farming led him to become inspired by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's viral video on sugarcane cultivation. Her expertise and passion for agriculture were evident during her appearance on 'Weekend with Ramesh,' where she also provided insights through a course developed for their platform. Fans appreciate her role as both an influencer in Karnataka's Sandalwood industry and a mentor who balances household responsibilities while actively engaging in farming activities, starting her workday at 5 AM to ensure tasks are completed before laborers begin at 6 AM. This enables her efficient time management around family commitments while contributing significantly to food production needs of society
