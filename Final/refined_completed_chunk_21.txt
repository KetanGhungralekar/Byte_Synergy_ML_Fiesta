In Kottalagi village, located in the Belagav district of Karnataka, a pioneering farmer named Sidra Irapa from L.D., Belagavanjala Taluk's Atmeyar Raitar area, has transformed his agricultural approach by starting a Srikandada Gidakala farm on Hattuekara land. Motivated by the value demonstrated by others like Menaka Nagamma's family, Sidra decided to cultivate Srikandada Gidakala trees as an alternative due to increasing costs of labor and inputs such as cow dung and medicines. This change was driven by economic necessity amidst declining returns on traditional crops.
Sidra has planted 325 fully-grown Srikandada trees per acre—more than twice the conventional number—across 10 acres of land he owns or leases (80 acres in total). His innovative methods have allowed him to yield around 1467 mature trees within three acres alone. This initiative not only represents a significant shift in local farming but also showcases how individuals are adapting to changing conditions through sustainable practices that promise better financial outcomes for their families and contributions towards building a better future for younger generations. The endeavor received appreciation from society at large with calls for continued support echoed across various platforms including social media where users were encouraged to 'like', 'share,' and subscribe via YouTube channels dedicated to spreading awareness about such transformative rural projects led by visionary farmers like Sidra Irapa.
