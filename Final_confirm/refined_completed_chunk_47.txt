The described garden protection system involves a network of devices including drones, night vision and day vision cameras connected to microchips and servers monitored by the Indian Wood Science and Technology Institute. The presence of any intruder in the garden triggers a signal. To ensure tree protection, it is recommended to plant at least 100 trees; however, one can opt for fewer trees if they are thick enough to deter cutting. Trees over 40-50 feet require specialized equipment to cut down effectively.
