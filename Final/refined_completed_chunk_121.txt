In establishing a Srikanth plantation, it's crucial to ensure that the planted trees receive ample sunlight, which is essential for their growth. The trees should not outgrow the supportive structure intended for them; otherwise, they might require additional support. Nutrient-rich soil and adequate space are necessary for proper tree development. Once established, securing the trees with robust protective measures like CCTV cameras or solar fencing becomes paramount due to potential threats such as illegal cutting or damage from rocks.
To manage and monitor each tree effectively, embedding chips allows tracking via the forest department's system—this ensures accountability even if a tree is cut down unlawfully. Proper planning and continuous care over 6 to 7 months followed by careful monitoring for at least three years lead to successful sustenance of up to ten years until maturity. This approach has been proven effective through practical experiences shared in the Freedom Map initiative within Sandalwood farms under an organic farming course offered by BMM Farm — a testament to transformative progressions resulting in significant financial gains and fulfillment without forgetting one's humble beginnings along this entrepreneurial journey towards becoming self-made millionaires within a few years—stories well worth sharing in future episodes for inspiration and motivation alike.
