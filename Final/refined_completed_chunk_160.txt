 A resident has lived on a piece of land for over a decade, during which time he and his wife have cultivated it, including dedicating some area to raise cows. He has contributed INR 3000 towards maintenance and now holds seven survey numbers for the property. Despite facing challenges such as heavy rainfall that led to the completion of 84 steps (out of 108) and financial loss amounting to nearly INR 9 lakhs, he remains determined to build a dam on the land for water conservation and reforestation purposes. His efforts were recognized when the district chief provided him with tools and equipment necessary for building the dam. Additionally, after waiting six decades, he finally obtained permission in the form of a gun license from the government due to threats posed by poachers near national parksâ€”a measure aimed at protecting their work on saving the dam. The individual is hopeful that both local authorities and governmental bodies will support them in maintaining this crucial piece of natural infrastructure against all odds.
