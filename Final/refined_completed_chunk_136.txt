The individual has been cultivating mulberry trees for 20 years with great success, as evidenced by the current price of 1 kg of mulberries fetching INR 16 lakhs (16 million). With this background, if they plan to sell 600 pairs of birds (assuming the reference is to poultry products sourced from their mulberry), they could potentially earn upwards of approximately INR 38 crores (38 billion). They emphasize the importance of diversification in agriculture beyond just planting trees; instead, one should consider integrative farming where losses in one area such as chickens can be offset by gains in others like mutton or fish. The speaker advocates for a holistic approach that includes understanding each aspect of farming within an ecosystem, especially when dealing with dry land and making decisions about tree placement and silage storage.

They also touch upon the need for commercial mindset in agriculture, challenging the common perception that sees it merely as a way of life rather than a business venture. The farmer suggests that adopting purely commercial approaches can lead to more sustainable and profitable operations compared to traditional methods focused solely on subsistence or profit without sustainability in mind. This seasoned farmer's message concludes with a call for recognition that even though farmers may seek financial gain through their work—like any other commercial enterprise—the true wisdom lies in knowing how every aspect comes together harmoniously across different fields within farming.
