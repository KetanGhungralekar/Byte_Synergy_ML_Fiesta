1. The selected site has been thoroughly surveyed, identifying both the lowest and highest points relative to water levels; water from an adjacent stream flows through these areas.
2. Drip irrigation channels and planting directions have been laid out in alignment with these identified points over the past year, facilitating intercropping primarily with coriander.
3. The coriander cultivation has shown impressive yields and profits since its inception, noting particularly rapid growth and early maturity within a year's time frame.
4. The plants have reached full bloom, exhibiting robust size and resilience against diseases such as those caused by Fevamsha due to organic fungal treatments applied instead of chemical sprays for disease management while maintaining a lush garden appearance without resorting to chemicals.
5. A notable feature of this plot is uniform plant growth across all specimens due to careful attention paid to seed sourcing from Srikandha mother plantsâ€”a key practice for achieving consistent sandalwood tree size and density when propagating from seeds or grafts (as opposed to natural variations).
6. Fruits collected weigh a minimum of 400 grams each at optimal harvest times using this methodology implemented near Hidikkal village in Belgaum district India (with coordinates provided upon request), where visitors can experience hands-on learning opportunities for developing similar gardens based on proven successful practices shared via another instructional video release by the grower who offers guided tours upon appointment for prospective farmers interested in replicating their successes which yield between 1-1.5 lakh rupees annually just from coriander alone, along with additional earnings generated by other crops mentioned earlier upwards of 2-3 lakh rupees per annum combined .
