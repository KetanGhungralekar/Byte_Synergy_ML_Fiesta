The discussed scenario involves a agricultural entity, Ramesh Balutti, with 5,000 acres of land and a subsidiary farm of 100 acres. They are currently engaged in supplying raw materials valued at INR 15,000 crores annually to Mouliyore Dhani Malik for the production of soap, cosmetics, perfumes, agarbathis, and related by-products. However, due to current restrictions enforced by KSDL (Karnataka State Macha Gramin Bank) and R&A (Registrar & Authentications), Ramesh Baluttti cannot directly process these crops as Mouliyore Dhani products. To circumvent this issue within the next few days to months after regulatory changes occur over the next two to three years when laws will allow direct sale from farmers like Ramesh Balutti to private entities without requiring permissions or going through intermediaries like KSDL.
Gandha Medicinal and Aromatic Company—a venture registered under their name—currently procures oils from other sources but plans to soon begin making its own soaps and cosmetics once they can legally purchase raw materials directly. The company is seeking liberalization in market regulations that would enable them access medical bills as proof of ownership for potential legal rights changes concerning their assets. With approval expected soon based on recent government discussions regarding agriculturally produced goods' market entry facilitation post-production processes including inspection grading drying rating fixing before final price determination upon reaching factory premises; immediate payments totaling about 45% of agreed prices at various stages including post-collection constitute part of the anticipated new terms upon deregulation. This shift towards direct sales promises optimism for more efficient transactions between producers like Ramesh Balutti and end product manufacturers such as Mouliyore Dhani Massage Oil Co., which anticipates significant growth opportunities following these policy adjustments.
