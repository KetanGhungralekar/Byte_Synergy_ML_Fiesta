Ramesh Devendra Pabbaluti, originally from Kushti in the Koppala district of Karnataka (now part of Kalyanakarnataka), hails from a family of farmers who have been cultivating dalembe since the 1980s across approximately 150 acres. His father, also named Devendra Pabbaluti, is not just a farmer but also the head of a national-level dalembe farm. Post the outbreak of Dundana Angamari or Bacterial Blight in Dalembe crops around 2006, they shifted their focus to Srikandha Bile cultivation and expanded it to 30 acres before increasing it further to 150 acres. They have additional farms in Egypt covering another 30 acres divided into three blocks: Mandil Mariyathara, Madal Gatti, and more dalembe farms dedicated solely to farming. Ramesh emphasizes their commitment to sustainable agriculture based on scientific research that supports healthy crop growth as evidenced by their successful plantations at Narsapura village near Kushti. He invites visitors interested in high-quality tree procurement for competitions and underscores his desire to provide excellence within various regional contexts such as Malinadu within Karnataka and extending supplies throughout Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra states.

This mix reflects both personal achievements alongside significant historical grounding embedded within familial agricultural legacies that span generations centered around dlamebhe cultivation techniques adapted due to unforeseen challenges faced over recent years becoming resil
