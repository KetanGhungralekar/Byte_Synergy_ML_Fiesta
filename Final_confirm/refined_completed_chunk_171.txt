 A significant forestation project involving the planting of over 10 lakh (1 million) trees has been undertaken by farmers who have successfully studied and implemented this initiative. The current market price for these trees stands at 2000 rupees per kg annually. This project encourages diversified tree growth, with some being cultivated in conjunction with Hebevi or amidst Papaya groves within the Moinum Forest area. Farmers have developed methods to grow these trees using organic means such as soap and detergent, which also allows for their cultivation alongside handicraft production. Despite the absence of a dedicated market, Srikanth provides a platform where farmers can sell their produce based on standard rates. The Chippa program was instituted to educate and prepare farmers to protect replanted saplings in markets, ensuring sustainability and innovation in farming practices facilitated by newly introduced technologies highlighted by Raghuraj's report on News 18 Kannada from Kuala Lumpur. Efforts are ongoing to expand market opportunities for these farmers through government initiatives and private support alike.
