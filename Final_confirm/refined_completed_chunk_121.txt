In the context of planting and nurturing trees, especially within the Srikanth plantation initiative, it's crucial to consider several factors for successful growth. The location must receive ample sunlight for photosynthesis; otherwise, plants should be less than neighboring trees to avoid competition for light and nutrients. Trees should be planted with consideration of their potential size to prevent future conflicts or damage. Investment in a robust security system post-growth is essential, particularly if the tree is prone to being cut downâ€”options include CCTV cameras and solar fencing. Additionally, tracking each tree via an embedded chip monitored by the forest department ensures accountability and protection against theft or illegal cutting.
