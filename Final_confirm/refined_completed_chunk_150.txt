Panpara, similar to its eponymous operations, utilizes the oil from Srikanth plants to produce a unique scent named after the crop. This essence is critical for the product's efficacy, hence it's termed "Srikanth's Fixed Tea." The significance of Srikanth lies in its versatility; it is cultivated across various regions including parts of Maharashtra and serves multiple purposes: from NGO work to training parties and engaging farmers in non-traditional agricultural areas.

The economic aspect of Srikathon stands out due to its specialized nature within India's agricultural sector. Understanding Srikanton's economics is crucial because it presents unique challenges that differ from other cropsâ€”challenges that require knowledgeable handling of agriculture management, market strategies, and pricing decisions. The complexity arises not only from managing Srikathon itself but also considering alternative hosts and intercropping options as part of sustainable farming practices.

Economic analysis reveals that despite being a challenging crop with no single dominant seed variety identified (thus necessitating careful selection), understanding the cost-benefit dynamics can lead to informed decisions about whether or not to invest in this crop over others. The choice of alternate hosting species plays a pivotal role in shaping these economics by influencing yields and profitability based on local conditions and demand patterns for both primary (Sriktan) and secondary crops (alternate hosts). Decision-making at every stage becomes imperative given these dynamic factors affecting farm income potential associated with Srikanto cultivation versus alternatives available within diverse ecological settings like Andhra Pradesh where this specialty plant thrives without published research data yet providing evidence through practical results reported thus far.
