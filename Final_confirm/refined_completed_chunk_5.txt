20 years of experience has culminated in an individual's commitment to a daily regimen where they draw a meter each day as part of their progress. Despite initially needing time to start, the person is currently at peace and ready to proceed with their plan. They report already achieving over 50% success due to natural regeneration and attribute this progress to having done their part, which contributes positively not just physically but also spiritually and visibly. With approximately 90% completion of their work, which represents hard work spanning two decades, the individual acknowledges there's still more effort required. This journey has led them towards embracing agriculture as a comprehensive solution for both sustenance (health) and enlightenment (spirituality), emphasizing its importance over other professions in terms of holistic well-being and economic support. The person plans further trips with family—considering these unplanned excursions opportunities for quality family time—and mentions past visits to ocean beaches and forest gardens during such times together.
