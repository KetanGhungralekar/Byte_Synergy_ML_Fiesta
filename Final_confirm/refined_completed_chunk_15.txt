Water conservation and distribution are key benefits of a community-driven initiative in Virajasannapuram, Chitrakoot, Karnataka. Venkatappa has successfully implemented rainwater harvesting by using bear structures to collect and channel water into a sustainable source for local farmers. The project involved planting thirsty seedlings like lilies and goldfish in sericulture tallers, which have become routine maintenance tasks performed regularly by the team. These efforts were inspired by educational videos found on YouTube and social media platforms. Although initially met with skepticism from some village farmers, the initiative gained traction as its effectiveness became evident; now several farmers contribute to covering the costs associated with maintaining these water collection systems out of gratitude for their reliability during dry spells. This model serves as an affordable solution aimed at assisting underprivileged villagers in accessing clean drinking water while also promoting environmental sustainability through natural resource management.
