The district in question is described as having a significant environmental influence and the potential to transform with proper utilization. The key point is that if the area under cultivation expands from 1000 acres to 10,000 acres, it could stabilize or even elevate market prices for crops like sandalwood, badni kaya, and tomatoes. These products do not follow a consistent pricing formula due to their unique qualities and non-perishable nature. Owning 500 acres can lead to substantial benefits through technology such as an Electronic Total Runtime (ETR) machine that measures agricultural parameters like area size, bark thickness, sapwood density, and oil content accurately. This tool ensures efficient management of farmland upwards of 500 acres for optimal market returns without needing manual assessment over larger areas.
For farmers who may lack financial resources or bank interest rates equivalent to these farming opportunities, investing in land provides tangible long-term benefits ranging from immediate commitments offering up to 12 kg of produce annually/yearly payment depending on investment timingâ€”potentially reaching upwards of INR 2 lakh after five years. Srikanth Belibadurai's story serves as an example; his commitment goes beyond just owning land but also involves building infrastructure such as collars for crops which can command higher prices despite national production trends that might suppress individual seller rates otherwise. Thus emphasizing the importance of localized effort and innovation within agriculture sectors for sustainable economic growth
