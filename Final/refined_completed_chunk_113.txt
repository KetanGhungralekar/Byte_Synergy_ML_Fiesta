The government has allocated funds to expand and maintain its forest areas, which are currently seeing growth due to active cultivation. Over the past three years, efforts have focused on nurturing these trees with innovative methods like using microchips for better control and protection. Srikanth is responsible for growing the trees, and maintaining them is crucial especially over the next 20 days. The forest's sustainability relies not only on tree growth but also on adequate air circulation within and around the forests. Additionally, there's a plan to protect a bedouin-made product originating from Maratha regions that could potentially benefit poor communities if distributed globallyâ€”particularly in countries like Australia where it is gaining popularity. Overall, while market expansion is promising with an annual price increase for these products, advocates note that more robust support from both private entities and government agencies would enhance conservation efforts further.
