In a heartfelt conversation, an individual expresses their distress about feeling financially insecure despite their colleagues' affluence. They mention that engaging in business could lead to poverty for themselves and their family due to debts. The person clarifies they are not planning to sell their home but suggests that others might consider it if pushed by desperate circumstances. There is a discussion regarding the Rathna tree, which is highly valued; Muthu claims knowledge of its significance and medicinal properties, particularly as an antidote for a rare poison. Despite skepticism from Sanjeeva, Kesava, and Appa who question the practicality of earning through such trees because of the difficulty in obtaining them, Muthu stands firm on their benefits—not just monetarily but also for air purification and promoting health. This leads to a situation where Muthu advises planting more Rathna trees due to his belief in its unique value among wealthy individuals who would appreciate its rarity enough to pay generously. A tense moment arises when someone close accuses another (possibly Muthu himself) of being poisoned by an unusual toxic substance known only to be counteracted by parts of the Rathna tree—underscoring its exceptional importance amidst potential dramatic twists related to life-saving measures and financial exchanges involving this extraordinarily valuable resource. Amidst these challenges, Muthu remains steadfast in advocating for the Rathna tree's worth both economically and medically while addressing broader issues around social hierarchy based on wealth disparities.
