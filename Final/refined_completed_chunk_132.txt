 The Jagatika market in Karnataka is recognized for its potential medicinal and aromatic products, particularly sandalwood (Srikandha). Currently, there is significant demand for this raw material across the state. Srikandha has gained substantial value; a kilogram of pure sandalwood oil retails at around Rs. 5 lakhs per kg within Karnataka's markets, with smaller quantities available for approximately Rs. 2000 to Rs. 5000 depending on size and purityâ€”10gms for Rs. 50046 ($USD approx.) up to bulk purchases like 1kg at Rs. 5 lakhs ($USD approx.). This surge in valuation raises concerns about the possibility of exploitation or misrepresentation by traders who may inflate prices after changing the status of common stones to high-value Srikandha through scientific processes.
The government of Karnataka also retails sandalwood through its emporium, priced at roughly Rs. 26897 ($USD approx.) per kg, emphasizing the importance of responsible cultivation and trade practices amidst increasing global demand for natural resources like sandalwood from their agricultural lands which could yield over three tons combined within a decade if properly managed and cared for economically while ensuring environmental conservation and social responsibility without solely focusing on economic gains but integrating health aspects into sustainable development initiatives supported by various government schemes aimed at promoting agriculture based on local resources such as Srikandha .
