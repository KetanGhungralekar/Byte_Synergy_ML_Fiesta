The author and their family visited Naka and Ahibarara but missed a significant event, prompting them to later explore Mallynadu Farm in Karnataka. The farm employs innovative agricultural techniques that have led to substantial economic benefits. They observed a special temple on the premises, which they found impressive enough to stay at for an entire day with their extended family, noting its size and historic significance yet emphasizing how it provided them with spiritual fulfillment without physical discomfort.

The author expresses joy about the progressive work being done at Bisilnadan, where a new temple stands as a symbol of development—a testament to what small farmers can achieve. Despite not having vast landholdings like Ramesh did before his death, the author believes that even small families with just 2-3 acres can create sustainable forests or 'family forests' by diversifying tree species according to ecological suitability rather than pursuing large-scale monoculture agriculture like Israel does.

They stress the importance of understanding organic farming principles (the do's and don'ts) through trial and error without excessive investment since blindly adopting advanced methods without knowledge leads only to loss for farmers who often suffer financial setbacks after exhausting all resources due to debt pressures from loans preying on desperation born out of misinformation or traditional practices proving insufficient in modern conditions where less reliance on firewood is necessary compared to historical needs. Emphasizing sustainability over intensity, tradition when well within safe limits still holds value amidst rapidly changing agricultural dynamics today requiring balance between ancient wisdom and contemporary innovation for maintaining both environmental health (as exemplified by Grandfather Muthajja’s ongoing seed planting initiative despite health challenges) and economic stability among rural communities engaged in farming activities worldwide.
