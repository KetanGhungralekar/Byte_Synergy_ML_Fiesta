The speaker describes a location that is generally favorable for Ants and insects but detrimental to human skin due to its smelliness and decay. Despite the unfavorable conditions for humans, there is an ongoing effort to cultivate this area sustainably, primarily for the benefit of local wildlife such as birds. The community collectively gathers seeds without using fertilizers, relying on natural processes. A significant aspect of their ecological initiative involves feeding birds; they calculate the amount of water needed based on the number of microbes per drop, then scale up these drops in multiples from 1 rupee to 100 crore rupees.
This practice has been maintained over a period described by the speaker as roughly one and a half years—a shorter duration than mentioned initially—though he acknowledges others have managed similar endeavors for two decades. The speaker draws analogies between his efforts and those of historical figures like Mookul Thumbeth in Uttarakhand and Ucchi Chidathara, positioning himself as someone with substantial resources akin to Savkara Apparadhani. His ultimate aspiration is ambitious: he seeks not only ownership but control over vast expanses of land through sustainable practices that support both nature's creatures and agriculture alike. His compensation seems less important compared to his mission-driven purpose, which revolves around constructing new lands from scratch by leveraging existing ecosystems alongside human interventions.
