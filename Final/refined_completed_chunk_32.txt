The discussion revolves around the cultivation and utility of Kempu moon (blood moon) trees, which are highly popular in India both domestically and internationally. This species, also known as red sandalwood or Pterocarpus santalinus, is second only to teak in prevalence within the country. It's valued for its dense wood and attractive bole shape. Along with being a favored material for making musical instruments due to its voluminous quality, it's famed globally for crafting lexicical branch textsâ€”a form of writing that uses long vertical strokes on thin rectangles of wood. The tree grows up to 8 meters with an impressively broad trunk width of about half that size. In ancient times, it was revered not just religiously but also numerously; historians note nearly 120 relics associated with blood moons in archives across Asia.
For optimal growth, Kempu Chandana requires well-drained soil and adequate space; each mature tree can yield approximately 500 kg of heartwood over ten years after being planted at a spacing of four by four meters post transplantation when they reach 45 cm tall individually from their base in pairs radiating outwardly at different angles beneath existing vegetation anchors such as larger stones/roots embedded deep into solid earth layers below ground surface level before planting occurs during May through June months under decent growing conditions suitable for dryand busy environments once established without special maintenance other than periodic watering needs met throughout its life cycle until harvest season arrives after decade-long maturation process has been completed successfully resulting vibrant lumber prized worldwide especially by musicians seeking high fidelity acoustic properties inherent within this natural resource extracted sustainably if managed correctly by local authorities responsible enough to enforce regulations against illegal logging practices detrimental not only ecosystem health but economiesdependent upon these precious forests too."
