The speaker discusses the protection and management of young trees grown in a small area, indicating plans to move them to a camp at night for security. They emphasize the higher value of younger trees but admit that important items, including forestry documents, are kept externally due to insufficient storage like bank lockers. The estates they manage have implemented various security measures such as fencing over 100 hectares with chain link mesh, watch towers, guard dogs, and natural barriers. Despite these efforts, CCTV installation is under consideration.
The speech also highlights an interest from the central government after officials visited their project to understand how sandal estates operate alongside farmers' partnerships. There's a suggestion for creating initiatives similar to coffee or tea plantations using sandalwood estates. A debate arises about securing land acquisitions; specifically mentioning "Gundupet" village where Prash anticipates acquiring 2-3 lakh square feet (approximately 250-375 acres) by next year if available at affordable rates compared to previous years which were preferable but less consistent due partly to agriculture demand during rainy seasons. Additionally mentioned is Maratha farms developed in Riyadhitri district plots sized between one rupee (smallest unit of measurement) and three rupees each, subsidized daily costs ranging from INR 17-INR 20 per day charged only INR three for maintenance expenses while housing rent discussions suggest tariffs around INR ten for comparable accommodation options or even alternative arrangements involving papayas as part of rental agreements (though unclear whether literally).
