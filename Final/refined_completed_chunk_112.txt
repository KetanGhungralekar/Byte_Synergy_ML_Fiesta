The maintenance of the soil involves managing a rake, which needs to be cut by half an inch to prevent it from being damaged. The decision on whether to replace or repair the rake depends on its conditionâ€”if the drip system requires adjustment for optimal plant health, as is also done for plants that may suffer if cut improperly. There's a potential agricultural enterprise involving seeds collected from Srikandu, where locals collect and sell "Sosi" plants grown from these seeds back to buyers. These Sosi plants are native to the mountains and can grow naturally there; however, they require careful handling when transplanted elsewhere. Since starting with Srikandu infections and age have posed challenges but were manageable with proper care such as 'drenching'. Financially speaking, investments made at the beginning have paid off significantly over time due mainly to government permissions allowing for commercial cultivation of these crops after 15 years of growth leading up to sustainable market prices currently set at around 16000 per kg. With approximately 5 acres available for this type of farming, there's potential for both local farmers who traditionally rotated their activities between one or two acres before fully committing to srikandu cultivation and those looking into expanding their operations within this niche market segment. While some disease issues persist in older rakes particularly affecting production levels under irrigation conditions necessitating continuous improvement strategies despite existing limitations relatedto resource availability like forest land resources which are thankfully growing well alongside other fauna & flora in harmony with human endeavors in agriculture
