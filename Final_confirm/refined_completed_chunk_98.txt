70 acres of Dalyambe forest, owned by the Pobaluti family since the 1980s and currently co-owned with Srikanth Belibadurai, has been sustainably managed. The ancestors of the current owners invested significantly in developing infrastructure within this forested land. With an annual retail market potential estimated at INR 1 crore, recent growth has seen multiple successful enterprises within the region. Recognizing the importance of biodiversity, no fruit harvesting or deforestation has occurred to ensure a thriving ecosystem for local wildlife like birds who contribute to regeneration through natural seed dispersal. As a result, it is reported that this year's crop yield from these unharvested trees—termed "topra"—is exceptionally high due to favorable conditions and minimal human intervention.

The property includes an AC room designed specifically for bird habitation as part of its eco-friendly ethos. Efforts are focused on enhancing avian habitats without artificial interference; thus, the land value stands at approximately INR 1 lakh (one lakh rupees). Despite not engaging in traditional logging practices or exploiting timber resources which could potentially raise revenue higher than their conservative estimates suggest--the inherent worth lies in maintaining ecological balance rather than financial profit alone. This approach emphasizes nature's role in sustainable development and prioritizes preservation over monetary gains effectively balancing environmental stewardship and economic viability within this unique habitat provided by Srikandha's ancestral land.
