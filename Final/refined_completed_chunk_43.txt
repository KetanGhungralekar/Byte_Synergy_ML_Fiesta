The plant in question, which emits a distinctive odor, is native to Uttarakhand and grows particularly well in Kempumishrita and Lomi soils. The government of India supports this plant, providing farmers with ₹30 per month without the need for any formal permissions. There is significant market demand for this plant, especially after two decades of scarcity where it was difficult to meet food requirements. This has led to high interest among people across Karnataka for products like rice, dalambi (lentils), and mao (sorghum). The plant can be cultivated alongside other crops but requires around 8-10 minutes of direct sunlight daily during its growth phase. It has been observed that incorporating specific hormone treatments into the farming process can enhance wood formation without adverse effects. Cultivation of these plants commenced this year and they are expected to yield substantial financial returns; indeed, individual trees can potentially fetch upwards of ₹120,000 in the private market once fully grown.
