In the 1980s, the area around the university campus was known for its smelly trees. A professor recalls that both the trees and a person named Sreekanth were constantly emitting odors. By 1983, when the speaker arrived at the campus, efforts had been made to eliminate these smelly trees, significantly increasing greenery; there are now countless trees visible from above. The university seems to prioritize tree maintenance as evidenced by their actions towards "black milk" productionâ€”a process involving daily sacrifices of approximately two to three mature roadside or larger internal trees each day. Despite this tree removal, smaller dead trees are left untouched for weeks before being chopped into pieces and taken away. Strangely, no complaints about smell have been reported since early plantation activities began at century's turnover point reforesting an entire valley between buildings on campus where a team responsible for maintaining forest health operates alongside those involved in tree felling under a committee termed "the fear committee."
