The speaker reflects on the process of land reclamation for timber production, highlighting the cyclical nature of growth and cultivation. They note the importance of natural pruning in plant health and describe an agricultural method where soil is taken from one area and used to grow plants that thrive without dependence on the original soil quality. The speaker emphasizes a point system indicating progression over timeâ€”from initial seed planting (seed number 1) to significant growth within 10 years, reaching up to 990 times growth within 1000 years. This concept is tied to an 'IAS seed' which has been rigorously tested, passed exams metaphorically compared to real-life assessments, and has grown physically well with excellent surface coverage. The speaker suggests that this particular species was naturally regenerated through birds' droppings and exemplifies the beauty of sandalwood trees. In conclusion, despite facing challenges such as land transformations driven by human labor or diseases like coronavirus lastingfor millennia, there remains hope in nature's ability to regenerate and adapt through processes like these observed in sandalwood cultivation. Key points include:
- Land reclamation via worker efforts for wood harvesting purposes.
- Emphasis on natural pruning for optimal plant development (secondary metabolism).
- Soil transplant technique leading to successful plant establishment regardless of original soil type after approximately a decade.
- A specific reference to 'IAS seed,' which underwent tests similar to actual examinations before being brought onto active duty; it demonstrates rapid physical growth both above ground level across its entirety following regrowth protocol involving bird droppings contributing towards its luster known uniquely among Sandalwood varieties referred earlier as "the beauty."
