Over a span of three years, including two years of active planting and one year of observation, I have successfully planted 300 trees across 3 acres. The first plot has been cultivated for two years now, and we've begun to see positive results there. However, the outcomes on another plot are still uncertain due to issues with tree health; the colors appear off and the density is lower than expected—only about 30-40 trees per acre are thriving. To address this issue, I initiated an investigation into Srikandha tree species diversity and propagation methods in Sriphandan.
Sri Lankan Srikandha varieties consist of specific castes that adapt differently depending on soil type: some thrive in firm soils while others prefer soft ones. Predictably, variations in climate and soil composition influence growth rates significantly. In Canada, for instance, locally available caste variants grow better than those from Sri Lanka due to favorable environmental conditions—their yield exceeds ours by over 20%.

For optimal growth in soft soil conditions typically found at Godhara or Mallinayak regions within India, continuous irrigation is necessary for seven consecutive years initially with intensive watering schedules alternating between irrigating cycles lasting two days followed by drying periods ranging from half an hour upwards based on soil moisture levels observed over time. A specialized gold paste treatment applied annually after one year serves as the sole medication required for these plants without necessitating additional medicinal interventions throughout their lifecycle.

Regarding commercial viability studies indicate that significant investments need to be made under government regulations which involve paying approximately INR 24k (USD ~$355) annually until reaching maturity around decade mark; however potential returns can justify these initial costs once matured since farmers stand to earn upwards INR 1 million (USD ~$14k) before entering the tenth year post-planting phase if all goes well without delays or setbacks as experienced during my tenure thus far where delays resulted in extended working periods yet reasonably led to anticipated earnings within a shorter duration compared to traditional timelines associated with other farm produce like rice or wheat crops commonly grown regionally
