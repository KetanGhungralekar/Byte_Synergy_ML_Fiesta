The paragraph discusses the evolution of food culture, particularly in rural areas where inhabitants now have access to a variety of fresh fruits such as apples, oranges, and dragon fruit. It highlights a shift from reliance on traditional agricultural practices to a point where farmers could potentially abandon farming for other livelihoods due to increased education and changing attitudes towards agriculture. The text emphasizes the importance of natural products like coconut trees, cactus plants, agarwood (used for making incense sticks called agarbathi), red sandalwood (which is highly valued and expensive), and sandaline within the local ecosystem. It provides specific information about the cultivation and pricing of these commodities. For instance:

- Sandalwood can cost upwards of INR 8 million per tonne in Bengaluru/Mysore with oil content requirement at 30-40%.
- A kilogramme of KSDL (Karnataka Sandal Wood Ltd) should contain around 40% oil by weight. In Sri Krishna Devaraya market in Hosur Road, Bangalore (specifically Srikanteerava Market), it costs between INR 80 lakh to INR 1 crore 20 lakhs per tonne depending on quality factors like age and purity tests measuring chemical compositions including santalol isomers(alpha & beta) along with santalin IIA/III B TOFA ratios which must exceed over 95%, indicating authenticity .
- Agarbathi derived from agarwood has significant economic value due to its aromatic properties when properly processed after undergoing fungal infection leading to natural drying without stacking directly since this would result in loss of fragrance.
