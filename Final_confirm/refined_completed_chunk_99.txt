 The speaker emphasizes the importance of creating a sustainable forest ecosystem that supports local bird populations. They've been working on this initiative at a studio and TV channel setting. The goal is to cultivate a healthy forest where birds can find both food and shelter, countering a current situation described as "a bad forest." The proposed design involves planting trees using 10 seeds within a 15-foot radius; each seed has the potential to grow into a mature tree in one day when tended by birds. Calculations suggest that if each bird consumes 100 grams of food daily, over three months (36 days), they could collectively move up to 36 kilograms of soil rich in nutrients such as phosphorus, gibberellins, oxygen, cytokinins, sulfur through their foraging activities. This process enriches the soil with organic carbon and promotes microbial activity beneath the surface which Is crucial for soil health and plant growth.
The success of this method depends on belief in its viability but also recognizes the value added to land because of these practices. The speaker concludes by reaffirming confidence in this ecological approach despite visible immediate results or skepticism from others who might not appreciate its long-term benefits
