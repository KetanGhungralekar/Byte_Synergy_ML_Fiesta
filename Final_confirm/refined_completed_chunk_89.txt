800 Shrigandha farmers from the Aranee area have received support, with 400 cultivating on their wives' land and another four on Jaffar Miya's land. Notably, Jaffar Miya employs distinct farming techniques that have proven successful due to scientific agricultural methods supported by substantial investments. Aathaa, a local agronome celebrated both domestically and internationally for her contributions to agriculture—particularly after gaining recognition through TV9 coverage—has been instrumental in popularizing the teachings of Sri Gandhada beyond India's borders. Vishu Kumar, who was once obscure in Manguru district but gained fame through discussions about his involvement at Sri Gandhada's birth and subsequent achievements like Lalana Pallan, is now recognized globally as an advocate of sustainable farming practices. His work has influenced many across Malavi and Africa where he has spread knowledge about Sri Gandhada's agricultural principles post visiting 'Gandhada Gudi,' a program dedicated to these practices. In appreciation of his efforts, Vishu Kumar was invited by the government to share insights into Sri Gandhada within his home country following documentaries highlighting his successes in transforming rural landscapes under traditional names like Madhariya while promoting Indian agriculture worldwide aspiring others towards similar accomplishments hailing him as 'Malinanda.'
