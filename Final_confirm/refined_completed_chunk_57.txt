In Kolar, I observed a successful sandalwood cultivation initiative at Mao. The area is known for its favorable rent conditions and offers good houses along with thriving plantations. Dalimba, specifically in Kolar, stands out due to its high yield potential. It is anticipated that the production in Dariga Vadi Bili will surpass previous periods, potentially doubling yields as it matures beyond the initial growth stage. These trees are expected to compete with others like Surya Rashmi and Gali but remain trouble-free until they reach maturity around 15 years. Initial harvests from individual mature trees range from 4-5 kg to over 10 kg of product annually.
The region hosts several government entities such as Arunachala for forestry resources, a sandalwood factory manufacturing soap and detergent under Mysore Sandal Soap Works Limited (MSSW), and artisan workshops producing handcrafted items using local materials like Karakulksha and Kusala products from Karnataka. Farmers are facing challenges with electricity supply issues which compromises their operations significantly.
Mr. Poonati emphasized the importance of soil conservation efforts; his team has worked on maintaining seven fields over years to ensure sustainable agricultural practices leading up to projects like Kayisyur Siddhaya where further strategies can be developed after consulting experts who will provide necessary information for successive stages of development once contacted through this platform initiated by Mr. Poonati himselfâ€”expressing gratitude towards everyone present during his discourse at Siamanga district's Taluka office where he has served for twelve years nurturing his son Sanjeshri's career as a nursery teacher while also establishing extensive sandalwood forests across 20 acres over an eleven-year span since he began these endeavors three or four decades ago now focusing on both environmental stewardship and economic sustainability in agriculture sector particularly within the domain of sandalwood cultivation & processing industry
