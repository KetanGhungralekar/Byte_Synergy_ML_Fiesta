2001-2002 marked a pivotal year for the area under discussion, with the passing of a law concerning property in Srikanth's region, previously owned by white settlers. Following the law's enactment, Manoj requested half a cup of water and questioned about his section during a meeting where discussions included infrastructure development near markets designated for KSDL. Mysore Chandel and others emphasized the need for competitive pricing due to monopolistic tendencies in the market favoring one seller or one buyer scenarios, analogous to business empires like Ambani's.
The local sandalwood trade exemplifies economic monopsony—a single buyer with multiple sellers—where exploitation occurs as farmers lack bargaining power and receive uniform rates without negotiation opportunities. The government was urged to address these issues by advocating against such exploitations and supporting fair practices through continuous dialogue with associations representing farmers' interests while also considering selling from other sources to prevent dependency on KSDL's monopoly structure.
