GS Kamthar, with 16 years of experience in the industry, emphasizes the plight of sadhakas and badakas who seek permits from government officers. These individuals, often perceived as beggars due to their daily rituals offering small gifts to bureaucrats, are demanding a system where they receive authorized permits based on necessity rather than patronage or bribery. Kamthar argues that these workers have already accumulated vast amounts of goods over the years and should not be expected to give additional gifts. Instead, he advocates for fair compensation directly from authorities and regulated working hours outlined in industrial laws—like those applied in factories outside Mysore—which have led to sacrifices by many farmers.
He points out that despite being entitled to sell raw materials at reasonable rates and having multiple buyers available for purchase during construction periods, workers face challenges such as securing payment without sleeping overnight near work sites or offices. Kamthar suggests addressing these issues through discussions among stakeholders including government officials but cautions against illegal actions like removing regulatory chains that ensure legal operations within a political framework aimed at preventing corruption leading to imprisonment based on past experiences. He concludes his appeal by highlighting his commitment as an active member of Bijapur society involved in employment-related activities (PAI_System).
