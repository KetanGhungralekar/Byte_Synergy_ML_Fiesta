9 crores (approximately $120 million) was cited as an excessively high figure for the cost of building a fort, which is not necessary according to the speaker. The focus shifted to a vision of creating a forest in Bishil Nadu/Bharad Nadu, envisioning it as a sanctuary for life and education. The area already boasts 500 benign trees, which are part of the natural ecosystem that includes around 15,000 trees and diverse wildlife like birds. Azadrecta indica, India's national tree, is present among them. This region has experienced natural regeneration without human intervention due to its favorable conditions.
The site demonstrates organic carbon creation through ecological interactions within the forest environment. It is suggested that there are more than just trees; there's also vegetation and various plants contributing to what could be studied extensively enough for a PhD on biodiversity and habitats right here at this locationâ€”each plant or tree represents scientific knowledge that can be quantified numerically in terms of branches or growth metrics indicative of life cycles within this ecosystem.

Furthermore, efforts are underway for protection programs involving numbering of species (including traps) and research initiatives planned over two to three years based on ongoing scientific study carried out by those involved with these conservation projects who have been pivotal in documenting such findings beneath the earth's surface up to 10 feet deep using heavy lifting techniques nurturing sustainable development hand-in-hand with nature itself.
