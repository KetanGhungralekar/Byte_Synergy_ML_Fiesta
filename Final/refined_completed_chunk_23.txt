5 years ago, near Shrikatsa temple in India, a Srikandai savalambi tree and a paravalambi tree were identified at LAKKATRIRIGA. Among these trees, the chogisheethri was notable for growing independently until it required support due to dwarfism. Additionally, there are manuthuram, Juna, chennai (Neem), and old trees within the same area. Records indicate that vegetation growth was normal historically except for hardier species which struggled to thrive during that period. The current situation in Chandan reflects minimal growth over three decades since the community's establishment; however, efforts such as dish washing initiatives have been undertaken by residents like Pawan Krd., who has witnessed changes in farming practices over this timeframe on what once was a 5-acre landholding belonging to Setain. These changes reflect an evolution in local agricultural approaches aimed at sustainability and improvement of yields during the past five years
