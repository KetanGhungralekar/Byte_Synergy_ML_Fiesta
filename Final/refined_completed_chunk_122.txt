Pavitra Jain introduces a young farmer, aged 22, in her latest video. This aspiring farmer has 18 acres of land and is passionate about agriculture after completing his IT education. Despite having the option to pursue a conventional career, he chose farming due to its appeal and potential for independence, as evidenced by his subscription to a freedom app since its launch and securing a three-year premium plan. He has taken advantage of educational resources like Pawan Krd's courses on various crops such as dragon fruit, paper bag cultivation technique (Sree Gandha's Bagina), Dalimbe methodologies, among others. The younger generation shares their journey into agriculture while expressing their intention to grow seeds sustainably with an aim to cater to students who wish to engage in agricultural practices.
