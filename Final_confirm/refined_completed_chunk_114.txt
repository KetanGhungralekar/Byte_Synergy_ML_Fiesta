The passage describes a traditional agricultural practice where individuals from Sauri collect snow from the mountains each morning and transport it to nearby rivers. This activity has been ongoing for several years, with seeds being cultivated over 3-4 years before harvesting. During harvest time, farmers shake the plants to gather the seeds, which are then bought back by the government at a rate of approximately 500-500 Indian rupees per kg after drying them. The process is carefully managed to ensure minimal issues for farmers.
The community has also observed celestial events such as blood moons, noting that one particular moon measuring around 80 feet in diameter has been prominent over the past few years according to their teachings about the Lord, who is described as having 3,000 feet. The practice of seed distribution involves taking seeds directly from the government rather than private entities due to better quality control and support for local farmers. Farmers reserve and receive these seeds typically in June and July at a cost that is higher than anticipated by someâ€”while they pay just three rupees per kg themselves; there's an expectation or implied market price of fifty times that amount (50 rupees per kg).

This region prides itself on its fertile lands referred to as "land of fragrance," emphasizing its rich soil conducive to agriculture including seed cultivation and distribution practices that benefit both local communities and farmer livelihoods through efficient resource management guided by historical observations like those related to celestial phenomena such as blood moons referenced within their culture or religious beliefs.
