 In the upcoming food production project, the initial planting stage will focus on coconut trees planted from 8-inch by 12-inch bags in pits that are two feet by two feet. The seeds should be well-rotted farmyard manure and planted with compost for optimal growth. Approximately two seeds are planted per seedling to ensure healthy development. Accompanying the coconut trees, host plants are crucial as they provide essential support to the young saplings. For fertilization, a standard casual fertilizer beneficial for aeration is recommended. Additionally, intercropping within these host plants can include various varieties of trees like clean white trees and other vegetation to diversify the ecosystem healthily.
Madhusudan from Shirad inquired about government regulations regarding planting (specifically in Srikanth) and initiated clarification on this topic since there were assumptions about rules preventing seed dispersal upon maturity or ownership rights concerns over matured Sarikantha/Sandalwood/Arunela tree saplings transplanted onto private land which later became property of farmers after maturation; however, it was confirmed that there indeed has never been such a regulationâ€”these trees have always been considered government property until harvested or processed at authorized depots where fair pricing policies apply for payment back to farmers who cultivate them at no risk of legal complications now recognized as their full rightful control without any ambiguity according to current laws observed nationwide including India's successful sandalwood cultivation history documented across different regions of our country. Another questioner named Ashok from Darwada might follow up with additional queries related to this initiative based on these clarifications provided concerning regulatory clarity around crop management and ownership rights specific to certain species like Oldhamia hookeri known locally as Srikantha or Indian Sandalwood (Kasturiyalam).
