Amrut oil is a product from Nalarbet, Gulbarga district, with a strong market presence across states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra due to its high demand. Their success hinges on their commitment to organic practices; they do not use any chemicals but instead employ beneficial microorganisms like Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, PSB (Pararoia sorghicola), Vyam (Aspergillus awamori), Bacillus subtilis var. Nageliensis and Silica in their products for agricultural inputs—a blend known as "microbial mixture." This approach has led to the cultivation of approximately 250-300 varieties of plants at their facility without relying on synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. The operation prides itself on being entirely organic and offers diverse vegetable types that support ecosystem health by avoiding chemical interference. They also practice grafting techniques with Bodoli variety saplings which enable them to establish forests over 3-4 years. Amrut's founder is passionate about sustainable agriculture and emphasizes the importance of biodiversity in creating healthy environments for both crops and wildlife alike. Their vision extends beyond mere farming—it encompasses fostering harmony between nature and human activities through responsible stewardship of land resources using eco-friendly methods such as zero tillage where appropriate soils remain undisturbed maintaining soil structure integrity while encouraging beneficial fungi/bacteria populations naturally found within it..
