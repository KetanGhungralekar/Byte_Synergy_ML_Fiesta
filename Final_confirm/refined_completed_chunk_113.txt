The government has invested substantial funds into forest growth, which is showing positive results with trees developing steadily. However, to ensure the sustainability of these forests over the next 20 days, active maintenance is required. Srikanth's expertise in cultivating trees plays a crucial role here; his trees are being nurtured for continued growth and forest health. The current strategy involves using microchips for tree management, although there's recognition that this technology may need advancements or supplemental methods such as dogs, people, cameras for effective protection. Over three years, the government has supported these efforts financially through taxes and seen market expansion with increasing demand and prices annually. Additionally, private participation is contributing positively to this initiative. Export figures around the Bedouin product area (likely referring to timber or related products) show steady growth in regions like Maratha within India and abroad in countries such as Australia where it's gaining traction among impoverished communities due to its affordability and quality. Overall progress indicates a promising trajectory with continuous investment from both public and private sectors necessary for sustained success in maintaining healthy forests while also catering to international markets effectively within approximately two decades based on current trends reported by stakeholders involved in this venture.
