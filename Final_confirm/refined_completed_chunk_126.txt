In the discussion, it's emphasized that affordability is crucial for the success of a project. A cost-effective solution involves providing knowledge, utilizing cameras/sensors, setting up traps and dogs, conducting fencing without necessitating a full compound construction. An effective live fence can be established using matured bamboo within 5 feet from planting; for greater heights or to build a compound, taller varieties like thorny bamboo at 20 feet should be considered. The area also boasts diverse flora including strawberry, star gooseberry (locally known as kankola), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), cloves (Syzygium aromaticum), cinnamon trees, and spice plants such as garcinia indica which benefits liver health and blood circulation. These species are unique to certain regions like Bishil Nadu but have been introduced in this environment to create a Malaynadian atmosphere typical of Southern India's climate. Local biodiversity includes coffee bushes alongside native Elaki trees along with other crops like kari menusu (a type of curry leaf tree) growing both on soil level and on larger vegetation due to favorable humid conditions provided by the shade-loving species present there.
The tour also highlighted banana saplings intercropped with coffee plants creating an immersive experience reminiscent of traditional Indian lifestyles exemplified by vadasuri making—a cultural practice involving community participation under shady environments—which was part of what was observed during the visit. Additionally noted were fruit crops such as Bokova characterized by its red colorfulness and called "miracle fruit" due to its taste-modifying properties that turn sour foods into sweet experiences when eaten beforehand—akin to natural mulching through organic material accumulation while managing weed growth effectively beneath these abundant foliage coverings typically found around reservoirs where no artificial canals exist. Star fruits were also recognized similarly throughout this flourishing ecosystem rich in agricultural diversity and environmental conservation practices aimed at replicating regional climates without overtly altering existing landscapes economically and sustainably maintaining their inherent beauty spotted with marvelous fruits like Bokova amidst lush greenery year round fulfilling all atmospheric needs locally referred to as Kodagu or Coorg district famously known for its Coffee Estate areas complemented perfectly well with nature's own offer
