In the context of a farm managed by Ramesh IWST and other scientists, various individuals including Tinasapura, Kadi Poli, Sissas Kodrangalari, Tondiya Balli, Amrita Balli, and Dagadi Balli have participated in reforesting efforts. They've planted numerous trees with economic motives as part of their work. The unique aspect here is cultivating discolored trees which attract birds to an air-conditioned room where they are surprised by the presence of red grapes until around April. Sri Gandha Agriculture Course has significantly contributed to education with 3 crore INR earnings over three months while emphasizing the importance of soil, water (with Sri Gandha being recognized for abundant water resources), and favorable climate conditions that make it a distinctive agricultural center.
The National Health Organization provided substantial aid amounting to 22 thousand units per acre of land for scientific study in Sri Gandha. Despite challenges like semi-root parasitic dependencies within forests leading towards close sourcing issues ("πüllµµ"), there's potential for extensive research on agricultural practices through this program lasting up to two decades ahead. The course aims to address how much land should be fertilized under government support systems and explores topics such as sustainable agriculture techniques amidst constraints like availability and cleanliness of resources/resources ("Stri wind"). Landitting remains critical within Sri Gandha Agriculture studies due its impact on local ecosystems and economies.
