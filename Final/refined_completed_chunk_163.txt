Ramesh Balut, known for revitalizing the crooked bamboo of his sister's farm through sprout cultivation, has made significant contributions to Srikandh tree farming. His initiatives have led to the establishment of a training center in Kushtagiya spread over 1500 acres, where more than 250 young individuals have learned sustainable agroforestry practices focusing on Srikandh growth. Ramesh's efforts have earned him recognition with both the Golden News Award of Kannada and an accolade traceable to the 10th century. Despite these accomplishments, there is concern about environmental degradation and illegal activities within Gandha's land. The local police force appears complicit as criminal activity persists unchecked; when residents attempted to address this at VV campus overnight, they encountered negligible support from security personnel who failed to engage or investigate effectively. This incident highlights systemic issues within law enforcement that require immediate attention and action by authorities responsible for upholding justice and protecting natural resources.
