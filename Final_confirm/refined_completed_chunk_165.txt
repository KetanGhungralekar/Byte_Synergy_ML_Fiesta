The Besaya tree, specifically the variety cultivated by Srikanth in Karnataka, is a lucrative investment with significant returns after 14 years of growth. The initial purchase cost ranges between INR 50 to INR 100 per sapling and can increase up to 3-4% annually if maintained properly. After maturing for about 15 years, these trees can fetch prices in crores (INR 10 million+). Each fully grown Besaya tree yields approximately half a tonne (500 kg) each of timber and leaves that are highly valuable. To maximize profits from this investment, it's crucial not to consume or damage the wood while caring for the trees throughout their growing period. Inhabiting well-oriented homes is recommended before embarking on this venture but isn't strictly necessary unless you plan to start within five years since such houses may be scarce and potentially carry negative reputations at present due to being found mostly in rundown areas; however, over time they are expected to gain respectability and become comparable to educational institutions by the tenth year post-plantation. Post those first fifteen years of growth, one can begin harvesting livestock farming on these lands until ready to construct new housing structures without obtaining local government permission firstâ€”financing options include loans ranging from fifty thousand rupees upwards into crores (INR 28 million minimum), depending on your needs. Any question regarding this venture should be directed via comments where Srikanth will address them in his next video installment. He expresses gratitude for support and encourages viewers also likened him as "forest" content creator amidst forest imagery references throughout his presentation.
