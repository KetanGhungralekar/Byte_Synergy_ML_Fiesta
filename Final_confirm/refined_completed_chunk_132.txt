 THE Jagatika market in Karnataka is renowned for its potential medicinal and aromatic products, particularly sandalwood (Srikandha). The value of Srikandha has significantly increased over time, reaching up to Rs. 105 per kg, with attempts by certain entities to sell it at inflated prices misleading farmers since scientific advancements have transformed the commodity into high-value products like pure sandalwood oil. Retail pricing for these oils ranges from Rs. 2000 for a 5gm pack to Rs. 5 lakhs for a kilogram of pure oil in select markets such as Bangalore's Iswantpur and through government outlets like Kaveri Emporium where it fetches around Rs. 2600 per kg or approximately Rs. 26 crores per tonne. The state government offers various schemes supporting agricultural ventures utilizing land resources; investing one acre could yield about 3 tons of sandalwood within the next decade given proper cultivation practices currently being developed with technological advancements and supported by global market trends. This presents an opportunity for economic growth while emphasizing social responsibility towards environmental conservation and animal welfare in rural areas rich in natural wealth like Karnataka's Jaegerica region.
