In a royal party context, Srikandha, also known as Hager wood, when treated with sashi implants via grafting, requires specific environmental conditions but typically thrives under normal weather. Post-hunting season, holes are made in the wood to accommodate the hayal growth process. Srikandha maturation ranges from 15 to 20 years depending on cultivation methods. A single acre can support 150-200 sashi plants; excess planting may inhibit growth. The farmer must consider both main and sub prices for optimal financial outcomes without overplanting. Since acquiring authorization in 2014-15 from the government for cultivating Kasgi land, research has led to successful yields of around 3 crores worth of produce annually after six years of sustained effortâ€”a significant increase from initial attempts that yielded only 1-2 tons within three decades since starting farming based on various schemes that provide comprehensive training and certifications facilitating loan opportunities for farmers. With strategies aimed at growing up to approximately 8 million rupees' worth of crops per acre (double if intercropping), future prospects include diversifying beyond traditional turmeric (haldi) by focusing on its stem which is currently overlooked despite being edible and potentially profitable when used as an ingredient or nursery stock replacer for turmeric seeds available through private nurseries sponsored by government initiatives looking towards sustainable agricultural practices through innovative herbal crop management techniques.
