 The speaker, a wife of a farmer from Kerala, proudly shares her and her husband's achievements in agriculture over 8.5 years, having completed construction work on 8,000 houses. She emphasizes their reliance on natural farming techniques and the challenges they face without external labor or adequate water resources. Despite these difficulties, they have successfully implemented efficient irrigation methods with drippers providing different flow ratesâ€”4 liters per hour for Shrikhanda Balasur's crops and 10 liters per hour for farmers' crops. Their agricultural practices include creating sub walls to conserve moisture by closing off sections as needed based on water availability.
The speaker acknowledges her own weaknesses but transforms them into strengths through innovative strategies like utilizing flour and antioxidants when food sources are scarce due to heavy rains or soil disturbance, which enhances the fertility of the land naturally while combating dangerous organisms beneath the surface soil layers that impede microbial activities essential for sustainable agriculture. Her narrative underscores the urgency of addressing labor scarcity among local farmers who are currently unable to meet demands despite their industriousness building roads and managing exports from nothing but muddy pathways previously devoid of infrastructure like water access points or loading areas for vehicles now essential to their operation after constructing gates where necessary near constructed roadways laden with stones laid over leveled terrain chosen precisely because it had potential yet was undeveloped before their efforts began--all this she does with gratitude towards those who guide her while remaining silent about past grievances related to resource allocation within her community focused solely on progress under challenging circumstances
