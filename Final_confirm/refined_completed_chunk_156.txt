The agricultural practices discussed involve replacing all plants given by Sanlu students to ensure a high percentage of focus on sanitary conditions, which farmers attend to meticulously. A 3-to-4 year period is required for the cultivation of crops, with initial efforts involving watering the tractors before actual crop production begins after plant development and the onset of rainfall. The crops grown can be traditional corn or alternative leafy varieties enhanced with minerals, urea, and complex fertilizers as needed. Water management solutions include using one or two sathi buckets or drums in areas with scarce water resources. Regarding oilseed cultivation, depending on environmental factors and availability of natural ingredients, it typically takes between 10 to 20 years to mature; however, under optimal conditions with all necessary nutrients, oil production can start within four years but may initially have low yield. Practical evidence from personal experience suggests that significant heartwood formation and substantial oil content are achieved over this timeframe in well-managed gardens. There is also reference to information corroborating these findings sourced from a book about natural gardening practices.
