The tree in question is cultivated from fine grains and becomes mature with heartwood development over a period of 7 to 10 years. The heartwood, which constitutes approximately one-third of the tree's diameter at breast height, possesses notable medicinal properties and contributes significantly to the growth of the plant. In Aruniyal state, a nursery has successfully grown more than six lakh trees this year, with plans to increase production to over twenty lakh trees for the upcoming year. Despite strong agricultural support and promotion in Sasipalani, demand has been low; however, significant effort has been put into raising awareness through various channels like advertising on Pawgad platforms.
For harvesting purposes, trees need to reach an average height of around 400-435 cubic centimeters before being cut down at about ten feet above ground level. These trees thrive in diverse soil types including sandy lands and even black cotton soils but prefer well-drained 'Lomi' soils originally from dry land areas. A forest graduate named Kiran from Chitradurga raised concerns about using Chowdhubhoomi land—considered unsuitable due its non-conduciveness for shooting activities or as potential campsites/sand sites—for similar purposes despite his own acknowledged expertise as smart and useful within his field.
