 The African Blackwood, a highly valued species, stands tall between 20 to 40 feet and is distributed across 26 countries in Central and South Africa. This evergreen tree can live for up to 60 years and has significant cultural importance; however, it's facing threats due to overexploitation in regions like Kenya and Tanzania. The wood from this tree is incredibly dense, weighing approximately 8,000 pounds per cubic meter or around 7 lakh (7 million) rupees per kilogram internationally. It's renowned for its use in making musical instruments such as guitars as well as durable weapons. Despite its potential for crafting high-quality items, the future of the African Blackwood is uncertain due to deforestation pressures. Locally referred to as 'Rakka Chandana,' this valuable resource requires sustainable management practices given its slow growth rate and finite availability.
