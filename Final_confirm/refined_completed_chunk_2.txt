 A sustainable agricultural model is proposed that integrates diverse crops, oilseeds, and the cultivation of 50-60 trees per acre to create a food forest. This system supports both nature and farmers by providing wood for forests, food security with three varieties of seeds (red, gold peanut butter), and potentially high yields such as 10 tons of tomatoes per acre. The ecosystem will be developed over time to ensure long-term food production. Farmers can expect multiple harvests from different crops throughout their retirement years due to this diversified approach.
The model also distinguishes between two types of corn: one suited for chemical use and anotherfor scuba soil conditions. These corns are not hybrids but distinct varieties adapted to specific environments. Additionally, there is an emphasis on non-native plants that have been successfully integrated into the ecosystem alongside native species like the Sri Gandhara treeâ€”a hemiroot parasite that attaches itself to other trees during its growth phase rather than developing independently as most trees do. This Model promotes ecological balance while ensuring economic viability through various cropping cycles within a well-managed landscape setup based on crop rotation principles.
