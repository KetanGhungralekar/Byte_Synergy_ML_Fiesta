The passage discusses the importance of using appropriate methods in various scenarios, emphasizing the satisfaction derived from effective solutions. It highlights that rocks older than 20 years should not be used for a certain purpose, as identified by observable signs such as spider activity and numerous roots on the body of an object referred to as a Jeda, which is specifically designed for Adhyayana. There are 100 species of these Jeda, collectively known as Bale. The author clarifies that what appears to be flies around the tree are actually fruits produced by it and its branches—a natural occurrence indicative of biological control, also known as Jai Vika Niyantana.
This approach relies on environmental sustainability with minimal chemical usage or manual labor, promoting the storage of trees underwater and utilizing vacuum cleaners instead of conventional pest management techniques. The passage argues against aggressive reactions to every problem and suggests adopting simple methods like immersion (submerging issues) rather than confrontational approaches leading to unresolvable conflicts like divorce if both partners remain active participants in decision-making processes.
The author advocates for thinking beyond immediate reactions and considering long-term solutions based on natural principles seen within ecosystems that operate without human intervention while avoiding unnecessary actions like drawing charts when planting—unless necessary for planning purposes across different fields or contexts where no clear plan exists yet. Key statistics mentioned include age restrictions on rock use (20+ years old) and the number of Jeda/Bale species (100). Overall, it underscores the value of simplicity in problem-solving with ecological harmony at its core principle.
