The wall in question has existed for 18 to 25 years and has recently been upgraded with a security enhancement that involves installing a chip to enhance its functionality and durability. The chips, which range in price from 500 to 800 rupees, are designed to be both functional and aesthetically inconspicuous. They measure approximately 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches and are colored to blend with the wall, serving as a form of camouflage against visual detection. Despite this, there have been attempts at tampering within an estimated scent radius of about 5 feet above ground levelâ€”hence the need for additional protection like mesh barriers between 5 to 8 feet from the base of the wall (where smell is most potent). This meshing prevents unauthorized access or interference with the sensor chip embedded in these routine checks every two months due to potential sound issues during recording confirm that these measures effectively deter intrusion without significantly altering the appearance of any existing structures where they're installed.
