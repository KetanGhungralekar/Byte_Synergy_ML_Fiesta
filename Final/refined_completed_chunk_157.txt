Building a tree farm can take anywhere from 10 to 15 years, with variations in yield depending on the species. For example, within 10 years, one might harvest between 5-3 kg of rice per tree (depending on the variety), whereas in 15 years, yields could range from 10-20 kg. The success of the farm is influenced by proper maintenance and checking for pests like white ants; it's adaptable to various soil types including red/black/clay soils but thrives best in red loam or stone-rich environments due to higher oil content. Security measures must be implemented as trees are susceptible to theft or damage. Ideally, a sustainable tree farm should cover around 400 feet for optimal density and efficiency, although larger scales up to thousands of feet have been successfully managed if properly financed and maintained. Profits can be sustained over time using initial resources such as cut soap stored during setup years and diversifying crop varieties when mature seeds become available (e., Srikandha delivering approximately INR 100-INR 159 per kg). Regular replantation practices ensure continued production without stagnation; this approach has proven effective even after eight consecutive monsoon seasons without a single initial planting at their demonstrative site spanning nearly a kilometer where they also incorporate blood donation facilities into their farming operations that include diverse age stages of plants. Additionally, they cultivate silver oaks among other varieties for different purposes.
