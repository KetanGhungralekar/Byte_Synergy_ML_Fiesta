In Munnur, a project aiming to revive native sandalwood is underway. The initiative involves the restoration of sandalwood forests through natural means, including the dispersal of seeds by birdsâ€”specifically, those of the Aki species. This process has been observed and documented over multiple years (1-5), showcasing different stages of growth. The land in question is named Nandu and is renowned for its beautiful trees that are suitable for practices like Sravadara. Historically, a man attempted to create a forest in a desert but faced challenges due to conflicts among those involved. Despite this setback, the efforts in Nandu have proven successful without human intervention or harmonic conflict intensive methods being necessary. However, local communities face threats from dam construction projects that lack understanding or consideration for their way of life and environmental initiatives like ETR machines are currently unavailable due to technical issues compounded by new inventions arising as solutions evolve.
