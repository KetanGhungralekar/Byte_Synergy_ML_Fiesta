Ananth Padmanabhan, known as the father of Sandalwood cultivation, discusses the critical status of Sandalwood (referred to as Durgandhagudi in contrast to its historical name Gandhandhagudi) in Karnataka. Historically significant and once abundant, Sandalwood is now considered rare with an annual extraction quota set at 1570 to 1590 tons across India. However, actual harvesting amounts only between 70 to 80 tons due to overuse and lack of sales for oil within Karnataka. The Indian forest departments in states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala are struggling for support amidst high demand for sandalwood products. To address this issue, there's a push towards private sector involvement in sandalwood cultivation without the need for individual permits after recent policy amendments allowing up to 2 lakh seedlings per person/organization per year. These changes aim to empower private landowners who have received certificates from forest departments enabling them to farm sandalwood under agricultural transformation rights while ensuring conservation efforts led by government agencies remain intact. Despite some resistance on land use change concerns expressed by certain stakeholders against allocating state-owned lands exclusively for sandalwood farming., both Ananth Padmanabhan and local governments advocate that these reforms will be beneficial for sustainable development of the sandalwood industry with each state having jurisdiction over their respective forestry policies within a broad national framework governed by state subjects such as the Forest Department Rules.
