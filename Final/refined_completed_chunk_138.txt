The paragraph discusses the potential for significant financial success in agriculture through proper investment and utilization of resources such as land, trees, and marketing strategies. It emphasizes the importance of establishing Farmer Producing Organizations (FPOs) with knowledge about EPOs, which are supported by the central government to empower farmers. Despite efforts to promote these organizations, adoption has been low due to a lack of understanding or interest among many farmers. The speaker offers training sessions, noting that approximately 150 individuals have attended his workshops comparing agricultural practices on both sides of a farm over several years. He invites critical questions regarding blood donation versus Srikandha support systemsâ€”the latter being essential for long-term sustainability and involving various activities like wood procurement from hayal under the guidance of Hager wood techniques, which are considered highly valuable globally and command high prices in Karnataka. The speaker also highlights the overall expense associated with farming in Karnataka but acknowledges that he provides training related to Hager wood there due to its demand and value.
