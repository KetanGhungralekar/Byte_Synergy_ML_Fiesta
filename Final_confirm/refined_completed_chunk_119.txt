As an RTC (Range Tree Consultant) at an entry-level position, I was involved in the process of filing a case for tree harvesting. Post-harvesting, the trees are assessed for their moisture content. The harvesters, who are part of the automotive equipment used by our team, handle this task efficiently. Each tree is evaluated and categorized based on its quality and type; there are four categories: stem, root, sapwood/phloem (sap), soil adherents (dust), and bark.
The classification system under discussion is contested because it primarily suits forest-grown trees rather than those cultivated by farmers in Pippusulthana region of India. To address this issue, we had a meeting with government officials last November to propose revisions to ensure fairer rates for each category that reflect commercial value accurately. For instance, if the average rate per category is Rs 6000 and one purchases a class 1 tree from our association's farm inventory where sandalwood trees grow alongside Australian varieties across 15 different types within one acre area irrigated by seasonal water sources—the cost could escalate significantly up to Rs 12000 due to market demand variations among classes.
Furthermore, I visited BMM Organic Farm located within a one-acre plot focused on sustainable practices such as intercropping with protective companion plants ensuring survival rates increase when new sandalwood seedlings lack natural neighbor support systems until established enough for independence—a testament to organic farming innovation aimed at maximizing profitability while maintaining ecological balance without compromising beauty or health standards expected from high pedigree exotic wood species like Indian Sandalwood which also includes foreign variants such as Australian Sandalwood in its diverse plantation portfolio.
