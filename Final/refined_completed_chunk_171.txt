1. Over 10 lakh (1 million) trees have been planted by farmers who have adopted a new method of cultivation, which allows them to grow the trees yearly at a cost of approximately 2000 rupees per kilogram.

2. The initiative enables farmers to potentially increase their tree yield and diversify crops, with some being grown in conjunction with horticultural species like Papaya and alongside Hebevi plants within the Moinum Forest area.

3. This approach has proven effective as indicated by the fact that farming can now be done directly using soap, detergent, or even as handicrafts without compromising quality or growth rate. However, there is currently no established market for these trees yet.

4. Farmers interested in selling can purchase according to standard rates from Srikanth until an official market develops further due to government initiatives aimed at expanding agricultural markets for farmer benefit and sustainability over around 2-3 years while also ensuring protection against market volatility under projects like 'Chippa.' Raghuraj reports on this progress via News 18 Kannada from Kuala Lumpur, highlighting how this innovative technology has successfully reached farm communities thanks to ongoing research and support efforts led by experts dedicated to improving agricultural practices sustainably in India's rural sectors
