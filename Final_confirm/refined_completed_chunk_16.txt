The project was initiated with the primary objective of providing assistance to impoverished villagers. The initiative has been restated as having a singular, focused mission on enhancing the lives and welfare of these individuals through targeted support measures. While repetitive in emphasis, the goal remains clear: to offer help to those in need within the village community. No additional statistics or data were provided alongside this repeated intention.
