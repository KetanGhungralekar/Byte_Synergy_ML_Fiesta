 The Srikanda tree, also known as Hemiroot Parasite, is a highly valued species worldwide renowned for its distinctive fragrance. It is particularly sought after in both national and international markets due to its excellent cultivation practices. This evergreen parasitic tree lacks the ability to independently absorb water, minerals, and nutrients; instead, it relies on host plants for sustenance. Ideal host trees include Agroforest trees, Aranya Kurshi trees, Hebbe Teak (Honne), and Malabari Neem (Malayashrita). These hosts provide the necessary support system by supplying water and nutrients through their root networks.

For optimal growth of Srikanda's heartwood or oil-producing qualities—which thrive under high temperatures—the selection of a suitable hot and sunny host plant is crucial. The primary hosting phase lasts from 6 months to 2 years with plants like Togari Sheoreh (Muttidare Muni) serving this purpose well. After this period, a permanent host such as Miguesia Angeles – Revault ('Sashbeniya') should be established within close proximity post-planting of young Srikanda saplings to ensure soil fertility rich in essential nutrients that contribute significantly towards the overall health of matured Srikanda trees while enhancing yields substantially when grown alongside Glyricidia macrophylla(Glyrisidia). To summarize: Srikanda requires careful consideration during initial stages with appropriate low-statured primary hosts transitioning eventually to robust perennial ones like 'Sashbeniya', ensuring sustainable growth cycles beneficial for both the tree itself and surrounding ecosystems alike.**Key Statistics:** - Tree height: Around 5 feet tall upon maturity - Valuation: Highly valuable globally for its scent - Cultivation cost estimate: INR 10k–15k*Note: *The provided range for cultivation costs may vary based on several factors including location specificities.*
