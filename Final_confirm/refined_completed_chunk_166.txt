52% of the analyzed forest area experienced a high frequency of illegal incidents such as logging and poaching, while the remaining 48% has been relatively preserved. These activities resulted in significant deforestation within regions A1 (30%) and C2-C3 (70%), causing an overall loss of 95 hectares to these destructive practices. Notably, one specific spot deep inside region B was found to have several signs of illicit activity including sawdust residue and human footprints, indicating organized efforts to exploit the forest resources illegally. Conservationists are alarmed by this data and are working closely with law enforcement agencies to address these issues promptly before further damage occurs.
