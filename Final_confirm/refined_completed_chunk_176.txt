The area being described is heavily monitored with traps in place to prevent unauthorized access. If someone arrives seeking safety, there's a form they must complete, indicating that entry cannot be guaranteed. For those coming for work, collaboration with two individuals is required; lifting 10 kg successfully will enable movement beyond the trap areas. The environment presents multiple factors for consideration; however, the site has robust security measures in place, including protective programs based in India.

A recent incident involving a car and mobile device led to immediate action and confirmation of safety through alerts and notifications. Discussions about building a Srikandha—a structure mentioned metaphorically or as an actual architectural element—reveal complex dynamics influenced by non-linear relationships between plant size (which does not directly correlate with its volume or biomass), and its defense mechanisms such as bark thickness against rot and insect infestation which are part of the plant's secondary metabolism leading to oil accumulation . These considerations also take into account environmental stressors on the plants (e.g., symptoms manifesting like blackened wood resembling diamonds).

The age of the sandalwood trees under discussion ranges from 4 to 5 years old but show no signs of suffering despite being subjected to watering along with coconut application which promotes vegetative growth without causing undue stress or impacting market value due to their unique characteristics which pose challenges for protection efforts specifically tailored to these precious resources.
