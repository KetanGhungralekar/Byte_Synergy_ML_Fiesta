The speaker clarifies that there are no issues with the drum; initially, they chose not to play it, but after five years, at age 35, they began playing and aim to continue until age 40. They emphasize that their engagement in games is financially motivated—playing for various stakes ranging from 1200 to 60 rupees—and reiterate the importance of understanding when to cease such activities. The speaker notes a cultural aspect where villagers consume drum parts (likely referring to an edible part), which they believe brings good fortune as evidenced by being granted a coconut and a drum once in their life.
Moving on, the speaker expresses concern about Balashtra people and the potential loss of Shri Gandha cultivation's profitability. Citing current market rates of Shri Gandha at INR 16,000 per kg against recent farmer payments averaging around INR 128 per kg (with government support boosting it slightly higher), the speaker argues that setting prices too high could harm farmers by undervaluing their produce despite potentially inflated exchange rates offered by traders who sell back small quantities at much lower rates than what farmers receive directly from markets like KSD (Karnataka State Development Corporation). As an example, although today's rate was informedly stated as INR 11,500 per kg during a conversation with KSD's general manager earlier that day—a figure considered realistic yet surprising due to its prosperous implications for grain acquisition—the speaker chooses instead to advocate for transparency regarding minimum sale pricing based on economic viability rather than speculative or artificially inflated market values. This approach would ensure fair compensation for farmers while securing sufficient income through larger crop yields.
