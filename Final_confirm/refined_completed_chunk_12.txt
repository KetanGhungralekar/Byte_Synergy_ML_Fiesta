In a dream, I recalled the founding of our family farm with my father, where we constructed fortifications to protect animals from gunfire. The farm has been operational for 10-12 years and recently celebrated its 14th anniversary. Our history is marked by challenges, such as lack of water facilities initially; my father and I resolved this by manually drawing water from a well until we could install two motors that now effortlessly supply water without issues. We encountered difficulties with stone placement around the well but innovatively decided to use 8K blocks as they proved cost-effective after experimenting with different methods over one week and eventually constructing about 150 blocks complete with lighting installation on site. Theseblocks were spaced an foot apart to allow space for plant growth and rainwater absorption into the soil.
Beyond agriculture, there was advice against pursuing cinema or continuing software work in favor of focusing on daily life goals. My entrepreneurial journey includes creating KV Connect, our own product solution, and establishing a studio on our land where I've engaged in acting and dubbing roles for projects rooted within our community lands. As a child/teenager (the narrative shifts here), there was a significant tree known for its high-quality heartwood that played an important role in my past experiences or perhaps shaped some formative aspect of my character or decisions later in lifeâ€”this detail seems central yet somewhat out of context within the broader recounting of events related to the farm's development.
