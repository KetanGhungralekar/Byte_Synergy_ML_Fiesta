Devarajra Devarajra, wife of the local leader in Kurubareli, Chitradurga district, has initiated a project to create a new forest and requested community support. The locals are willing to assist her efforts and have already begun by exploring areas for forestation. The initiative is not only environmentally focused but also aims to provide housing for farmers as part of its broader objectives. During a visit to Kurubareli, the narrator was struck by the beauty of the area and met Raju and Timopar who play significant roles in this mission. Together with their team across Kaveri and Andoran districts, they care for approximately 25,000 children under their guardianship while also nurturing bird populations integral to maintaining an ecosystem reminiscent of a forest within cultivated fields.
The couple has been pivotal in agricultural development over eight years in Chitradurga district despite facing challenges from government policies that initially restricted Srikantabhildi's work â€“ necessitating approval from higher authorities like Mysore Sandalwood factory's MDs before proceeding with opening up sandalwood production operations on an industrial scale. Their commitment to sustainable agriculture coupled with environmental conservation exemplifies dedication at both personal and communal levels within these regions of Karnataka state.
