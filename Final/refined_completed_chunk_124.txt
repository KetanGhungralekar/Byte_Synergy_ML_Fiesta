22-year-old Pavitra Jain introduces a young farmer named Vijay from Yadagiri, who has been cultivating his own crops for 22 years. Despite completing a second PC and IT education, Vijay chose farming over business due to its appeal and the sense of freedom it offers. He manages an 18-acre farm with the help of his family members—his brother, father, and mother—on which he farms roughly ten acres dedicated to various crops including dragon fruit, paper plate vegetable (a type of leafy green), Sree Gandha's 'bagina', and Dalimbe using knowledge acquired through online courses inspired by the "freedom app" that he has followed since childhood with a three-year premium subscription. His journey into agriculture started early on when he recognized its potential as a sustainable career choice despite having initially pursued IT for entrepreneurial aspirations. His approach is hands-on; he is currently planting seeds harvested from previous batches in preparation for growing more crop varieties suitable for student farmers looking to enter the field of agriculture.
