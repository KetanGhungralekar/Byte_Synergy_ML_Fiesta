Sir, come here. Please give an introduction. Basically, he is an agri diploma. He is a full-time farming type. The people who are interested in this are 11 acres, right? Yes. They are developing one acre. Please give an introduction about when and where you started. My name is Vishwanath Nagar. I am from Balakot district. This is 11 acres of land. We have grown Srikandha in Reshmavallu. Next, we have Kajivarati, Neralai, Peru, Indakrapati, Anjuram. Next, we have Tengu, Sagwani. Next, we have Habeo. That was the first one. How many acres did you grow? 3 acres. They started from there. They started from Aranyakurshi. Then, in 2019, Srikandha and Akare Tegh. In this plot, Srikandha has grown in the Habeo plot. There, he has grown tea. For tea, forest department. Sandal is also the same. They have grown from forest. Along with this, they are growing reshmavallu. What is the distance between the two? 10 feet. Sandal to sandal. Row to row, space to space. Same. 10 bettons. They have planted 430 plants per acre. In between, they are growing reshmavallu. Exactly. 5 feet. Every 5 feet, they have planted reshmavallu. It started from 2019. It is the same. It is one year before that. First, they planted reshmavallu. Then, they planted sandal. Then, they planted sandal. Plant to plant. Each plant has 5 feet. But, from the soil, 10 feet. Then, the first host is the one who has planted the seed. How long has it been? It is more than one year. After that, they have planted the same. Come, let us see the garden. What is the age? It is one year. It is not much. It is growing well. It is growing well. It is one year. You can see it. Yes. It is growing well. It is 3 and half years. 4 years. It is 2019. It is 2019. You can see the growth. It is considered as 4 years. It is not completed within 4 years. Within 4 years, it is a good growth. What we do for this? We plan to host another one. Along with that, we plan for stress management. The growth should be as good as the heart. When there is excess growth, the formation of heart gets less. The reason is that tissues do not break down. Secondary metabolism is the tissue develops, breaks down and the formation of heart is a constant stress. It is consistency. Consistency is a constant connection. You should be stressed constantly. You will be exhausted. If you are stressed every time, before that, after 12 years, if you have targeted that time, if you want to cut, it is not extremely healthy. It is good in the initial stage. But maintaining it like that is wrong. We will discuss with sir what to do with secondary metabolism. It is 4 years since it came. What these trees have done? One simple thing is to drain the extreme nutrientsfrom the sand.
