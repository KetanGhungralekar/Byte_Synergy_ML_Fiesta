 The subject at hand is the cultivation of a specific crop, which has been identified as a 6-inch tree and represents the first harvest from this variety. Initial soil testing conducted at various collection points such as fishing centers, universities, and science labs has revealed that the sandy soil's pH ranges between 6.5 to 7.5, indicating it is suitable for planting due to its neutrality. A key consideration in selecting the land involves ensuring compatibility with 'srigan' trees—a select species for this crop—by assessing factors like organic carbon content to ensure high productivity levels.
The preparation process includes clearing any excess stones from the land while maintaining sufficient drainage without excessive expenditure on tap-draining systems. Proper slope orientation and water flow are crucial for effective irrigation post-planting (which follows after pit digging). This comprehensive approach ensures optimal conditions for successful agricultural yields prior to actual seedling placement into prepared pits on properly prepped land.
