In Manabes, SriKandakurshi is a region where the harvest of sandalwood, officially known as Santalum album but also referred to locally as Santalum spicatum or Santalum officinale (Santalam SC), is significant. The Karnataka government values one kilogram of this precious wood at INR 5 million. There are 16 recognized varieties of sandalwood globally, with India's sandalwood prized for its chemical composition containing up to 95% santalol and traces of santalin and santineelâ€”an ideal makeup considered the highest quality in global standards. This superior quality stems from local biological factors including soil, water, and climate unique to Karnataka's geography.
SriKandakurshi has been a center for sandalwood trade historically attracting international interest due to its high-quality yield after over 16 millennia. Researchers are now focused on understanding why this area continues to produce such exceptional qualities of sandalwood despite challenges like pollution and deforestation that threaten other ecosystems worldwide. Efforts are underway to protect these natural resources not only because they provide habitat for various species but also ensure that ancient cultural practices continue thriving without compromising environmental integrity or biodiversity conservation efforts in place today within this key ecological zone known colloquially as 'the land of Kannada' or 'land resembling paper.' It houses the largest cluster of naturally occurring mature native Indian rosewood trees (Paravythiga vayicularpa). These trees have adapted through semi-parasitic root systems allowing them to survive even amidst larger vegetation while contributing significantly towards maintaining an ecological balance in their surroundings.,
