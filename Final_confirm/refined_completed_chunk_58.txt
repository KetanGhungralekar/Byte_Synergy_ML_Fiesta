In 2010, I faced a dire situation with no land, fertile or otherwise, and lacked access to a reliable water source. My knowledge of my family was minimal, and I felt hopeless without meaningful work or purpose where I lived. Determined to make a change, I sought help at a stress center but found little relief as the underlying issues remained unsolved. It wasn't until after eight years that these challenges led to health problems for me.
Despite these setbacks, I persisted in finding solutions and eventually turned towards sustainable agricultural practices. After realizing that conventional monocropping methods were not suitable for the long-term sustainability of my land, I adopted an integrated approach known as holistic management which combines various farming practicesâ€”agriculture (short-term), agroforestry (mid-to long-term), and livestock husbandry (long-term). This system allows for diverse crops like L49 Taiwan Pink/White within three years and has enabled me to develop four distinct varieties of mangoes on my farm using unique cultivation techniques over the course of several years. These efforts have significantly improved crop yields on our One Acre Farm compared to traditional single cropping methods used previously by farmers in similar regions somehow willing earlier than us under Covid lockdown conditions!
