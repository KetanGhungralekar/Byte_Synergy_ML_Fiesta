1. The price discussed ranges from Rs. 100-120, with a specific mention of Rs. 50-55 at one point, but it is confirmed that the standard price was Rs. 120 per unit/item in question.

2. A farmer named Mr. Aishwarya planted approximately 375-400 acres about two decades ago and has since increased to planting on 2 acres currently, aiming for production that could potentially reach INR 25 crores if cultivation proceeds well over the next decade or so (up to twenty years).

3. He initially aimed to cultivate around 976 acres in total and stated his intention to take care of his children as part of his family responsibility ethosâ€”believing that taking care of children leadsto taking care of families overall; emphasizing self-reliance among farmers including the ability for even a single farmer to manage a substantial expanse of land such as several hundred or thousand acres by working hard and being dedicated towards their goals without external dependency or support systems like sharecropping arrangements ("Srikantan" not allowing him to delegate planting responsibilities).

4. He stressed early morning arrivals at farm sites starting at five o'clock AM due diligence regarding agricultural practices rather than prolonged waiting periods which could span ten to twelve years; suggesting active involvement in farming operations daily instead relying solely on long-term outcomes without consistent engagement throughout each growth cycle ("Turgbevo"and "Srigandha" mentioned as investments made into this endeavor).

5. Despite initial challenges leading them into debt, Mr Aishwarya expressed resilience having overcome previous financial difficulties associated with managing Turbhevo machinery trials under adverse circumstances marked by financial constraints requiring nighttime electrical work during critical moments when every minute counted toward salvaging their situation despite economic adversity faced before reaching an acceptable level where they can now reflect upon those times positive experiences while also encouraging others involved directly or indirectly within agriculture through responsible stewardship ('we cut off electricity', 'running late at night' indicative of past struggles).
