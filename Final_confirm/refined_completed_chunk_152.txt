To prepare for the pineapple (pitting) planting season in June, applicants must obtain subsidies from the forest department. The pittings are prepared and planted in June, coinciding with the onset of monsoon rains that ensure adequate water supply. Prior to planting, which should occur a month before or after the actual pitting activity, it is recommended to perform pitting during January and February when sunlight exposure can warm and aerate the topsoil layer (10-15 cm). This ensures optimal conditions for soil health and seedling growth. The size of each pit must match exactly with that of the seedling. Post-pitting but before planting, excess soil exposed to sunshine is removed from both sides of the pit to facilitate root penetration. Once cleaned, a plastic cover is temporarily placed over each seedling until it's time for transplanting into permanent positions without this cover; Formadin treatment is then applied to enhance water retention capabilities within what appears initially as small depressions made by flood irrigation methods used at planting time. This process guarantees uniformity in growth rates among young plants which later creates better crop yield success overall due to careful preplanning stages handled through late winter/early spring preparation efforts leading up into early summer cultivation activities with strategic timing considerations throughout various steps involved in pineapple farming under Subsidy programs supported by local Forest Departments here mentioned above.
