The health and growth of plants, particularly those attacked by borers, depend on the availability of oxygen in the soil. Human brains cannot survive without a constant supply of oxygen. For trees like Srikandha, which are susceptible to pests such as ROADBREAK, maintaining soil health is crucial. Organic methods like using nitrifycing trees can be effective alternatives to chemical fertilizers. If these measures aren't taken, and the soil lacks nutrients for 3-4 years during recovery from borer infestation, plants may suffer significantly.
Monitoring plant health involves visual inspection; mature plants should exhibit signs of healthy root development within a meter or 50 cm distance from the base when viewed at ground levelâ€”indicating proper water absorption and heat conduction from the soil through the stem. Coconuts serve as an indicator since their growth mirrors that of roots under stress or improvement conditions due to changes in temperature and moisture levels induced by borer activity or remediation efforts over several years (8 years post-plantation).

Root formation inspections involve checking for cracks between rice root bundles after artificially inducing stress by disturbing the existing root mass around age 21 months (approximately). Advanced technologies like electron-resistant tomography allow for non-destructive assessments of internal wood structures up to 6 years post- Root damage assessment can determine if an artificial root system has successfully developed via two methods: visual examination for natural crack patterns indicative of established art roots or employing increment borrow analysis techniques with electronic equipment passing currents through wood samples to analyze resistance pattern variations diagnostically confirming root presence/formation size approximately half a gram would typically indicate early stage coconut sapling maturity while larger sizes suggest more advanced stages in temperate climates compared with tropical settings where similar weight could denote immature specimens due to faster growing conditions.
