The neem plant, if repented (damaged or neglected), will likely die within 5-6 years. To avoid this, it's crucial to carefully manage the planting and growth of trees, specifically selecting varieties that do not compete adversely with others and ensuring they are properly irrigated. A permanent host should be established between four high-yielding dwarf plants for optimal growth in an area measured by a line passing through their centers. This setup is intended to last up to 20 years without issues like pests or disease affecting the entire forest due to diversified tree species planted alongside sandalwood saplings for competitive edge. Using sandalwood as a hosts can prevent problems associated with overcrowding and ensure better care when managing large tracts of land. It's also noted that fruit crops may face challenges but tree crops can thrive under similar conditions; additionally, milling practices must be considered with proper drainage systems in place every 4-5 years to maintain soil health around these valuable plants. Proper management is key for maintaining healthy forests and maximizing yields from both timber products like sandalwood and agroforestry enterprises such as fruit cultivation.
