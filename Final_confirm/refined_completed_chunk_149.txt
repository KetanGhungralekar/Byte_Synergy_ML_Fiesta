In the last decade, a farmer has been cultivating mangoes and other crops in his field. He emphasizes the importance of selecting the right host tree for successful growth, as evidenced by a 9-year plantation without proper research or internet access due to limited time for government and employee responsibilities. The farmer acknowledges that without adequate planning and attention to both fence maintenance and planting materials, there is a risk of crop loss through improper care or adverse effects from hosting plants that are not suitable.
He illustrates this with an example: A pomegranate plot where all plants died because of being planted next to broken species, which harmed the roots and nutrient supply. The farmer stresses the need for understanding soil nutrients and tailoring plant intake accordingly—considering amounts like 300Kg/ha fertilizer—to ensure sustainable farming practices.
To assist others in better planning their farms, he offers free consultations through sessions bookable via a registration link provided in the video description box. Additionally, he invites individuals to visit his offices in Hubli, Bangalore, Chennai for expert advice on farm design at no cost unless travel expenses require reimbursement upon vehicle usage charges. He encourages anyone with doubts about horticulture business ventures or agricultural practices to reach out for guidance directly related to their specific needs or challenges on their land (Total word count: 276).
