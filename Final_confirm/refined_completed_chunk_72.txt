 Vishwanath Nagar, a full-time farmer with an agri diploma from Balakot district, manages 11 acres of land where he has diversified his agriculture practices. On approximately 3 acres, he began cultivating Srikandha and Akare Tegh at Aranyakurshi in 2019, specifically in the Habeo plot. He intercrops Sandalwood among these crops, sourced from the forest department. Before planting Sandalwood, he grew Reshmavallu cashew nuts initially and then switched to Sandalwood after a year. The Sandalwood plants were spaced every 5 feet within rows that are 10 feet apart. Each acre hosts around 430 Sandalwood trees provided by the forest department. A year later (as of the date of narration), both Reshmavallu and Sandalwood are thriving on this farmland which is now about four years oldâ€”showing good growth despite being less than four years since planting began due to consistent care aimed at promoting secondary metabolism for optimal health and avoiding excessive nutrient buildup in the soil over time according to Vishwanath's sustainability focus for stress management and heart formation consistency within his crop yield strategy..
