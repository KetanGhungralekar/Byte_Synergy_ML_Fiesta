750 acres of farmland are irrigated using a system that involves watering daily during non-rainy periods and utilizing coconut water once a year to enhance crop yield. The irrigation strategy ensures optimal use of available water resources, including mud mixed with water. The entire 2 acres are covered by this method, which has faced challenges like uneven distribution initially but has been adjusted to maintain adequate water levels without issues even after heavy rainfall. This system is designed to sustain for more than 15 years and prevent problems such as salinity or pest infestations that could affect market prices, which can fluctuate up to 100 kilometers away due to various factors like supply and demand dynamics. Despite these uncertainties, the implementation of legal procedures regarding oil usage from the crops has ensured that farmers cannot freely choose their seeds; they must commit and endure losses if necessary, as seen in cases where there was a loss of INR 40,000. The future plan includes constructing a secure compound measuring approximately 26 meters in length (for reference: exactly twice the typical width of an international standard football pitch), ensuring sustainable growth without external interference while preparing for further development involving transportation infrastructure like buses specifically tailored for this purpose.
