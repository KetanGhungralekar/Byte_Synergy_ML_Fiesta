9 crores? What I mean is, you will also know this. The cost of building this fort is different. The 1 lakh crores, the rest of the money is here. Oh. The 9 crores. We don't need that much to live. We don't need crores. We can live in peace with some money. We don't need that much to live. What happens is, here itself is a wonder. Look here. Look at the birds. They eat everything. They have put the seeds. They have emptied all the plates. They are counting. This is my dream to build a forest in Bishil Nadu. I want to build a forest in Bharad Nadu. I want to take the form of a forest. There should be life, education and a lot of things. Here, we see the smell of the smell. These are all benign. Benign? These are all benign. These are all benign. Here, that is benign. That is benign. If you look here, there are about 500 benign trees here. 30 trees means that there are about 10,000 benign trees here. Oh. You left the trees for the last 100 years. Yes. In this, there are about 500-30 trees. You feel something when you walk here, right? You feel something when you walk on the grass, right? Yes. In the forest, organic carbon is created here. It is created here. It is created here. This is benign. What happens is, we ask, how many trees are there in this 100,000 trees? 100,000 trees are trees, trees, trees, birds, and birds. Not 100,000, 15,000 trees. 15,000 trees are trees, not benign trees. This is Azadrecta indica. Our national tree. This is a forest-like height. Here, natural regeneration is happening. Here, all this. We have seen that plot, right? What is the beauty of natural regeneration? This is actually forest cultivation. Here. That plant, plant, and trees. There is a whole universe. If you see this, you can make a whole PhD in this. You can see the plant. How much ever it is, it is a whole PhD. Like this. So, a plant is created for a number. One plant for that, one tree for that. All that is created for a number. That is the tree branches, the earth's growth, the life, the life's growth, the life's growth. All of this is created here. All these are the plants, right? All these are the plants. These are all the plants. This is the number, right? We have created all these. Oh, you have created the number. We have created all these. Okay. Why did you create the number? No, I did it myself. We were studying it. You have created the number. This is our scientific knowledge. I can't disclose it now. I will do it after another 2-3 years. This is the program for the protection. The numbering. There are traps inside this. If you just lift 10 kg, we will go inside at least 10 feet below. Youcan't go anywhere else with this plant.
