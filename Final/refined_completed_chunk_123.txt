This individual has a strong foundation in agriculture and farming, primarily learned from their father. They recognize the value of diverse experiences and have also gained insights from a carpenter. The person is currently engaged with educational content, having followed Kavitha Sri's tutorials extensively alongside four years of study under Srikanth, starting seven years ago. Additionally, they are influenced by Kavitha Mishra's course which they find exceptional. Their engagement with learning platforms has been transformative; it has not only provided them knowledge but also fostered independenceâ€”they credit the Freedom App for enabling this autonomy by allowing students to learn at their own pace without dependence on institutions or teachers.
The young man expresses aspirations to start a paper plate business within the next year and plans to pursue further education through Srikanthan Mara thereafter. He is interested in becoming a teacher, potentially both within government roles and independently tailored positions that align with his passion for agriculture and contribute to his personal growth and well-being. His goal is to integrate these pursuits into his future career path while advocating for others to access agricultural knowledge freely through digital means like the Freedom App or similar resources dedicated to vocational training in farming practices.
