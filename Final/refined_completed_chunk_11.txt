old police officer Sundar and his son, Abha Vishwa, played pivotal roles in the Kempammanna court case. Sundar is an only child, a software engineer known for his acting skills; he stands 6 feet 2 inches tall and has been lauded for his performance as well as directing a short film titled "Reckoning," which was under post-production at the user's studio. Sanjay Shantaram from their Swami Ayyappa film appeared in this short film alongside Manne Kempe Gowda, showcasing Sanjay's versatility as an actor. The user first met Sundar at Chowdaya Memorial where they discussed dance and recording; the user encouraged him to explore various acting techniques. Another disciple of the user named Vivekanth Bagalkoti is also involved in filmmaking; he is directing 'Kushmanda Roopa,' starring himself either as a second hero or an anti-hero. During work on this project, discussions about storytelling ensued, with Vivekanth showing enthusiasm that left some narratives unfinished due to his eagerness not to abandon them entirely. Additionally, there was mention of Chandanavanna Fort where they once searched for water sources beneath itâ€”likely related to Abha Vishwa's environmental efforts mentioned earlier in relation to sand conservation.
