A community with five houses in the village has a diverse economy, including a profession and various crops such as dhalambi, which is sustainable for 10 years before replanting. They practice both monocropping and diversified cropping methods to manage risks associated with crop fluctuations like blight. The villagers recognize the importance of collaboration; they advocate for joint efforts rather than individual endeavors to ensure their farming activities remain profitable over the long term. They are considering adopting hybrid seedlings that require three to four years of cultivation but promise higher yields post-maturation. Their agricultural plan involves seasonal planting and securing income every quarter by managing harvest times in June and October, ensuring consistent cash flow throughout the year. Despite having approximately 30 acres of land planted with seeds suited for multi-cropping or coconut cultivation—preferred for its natural refreshments during summers when it's scarce—they emphasize economic balance through different farming strategies while acknowledging external factors that could impact yields, such as market prices and weather conditions. Safety nets must be implemented within this framework due to potential unprofitability at low buying rates from markets where they sell their produce.
