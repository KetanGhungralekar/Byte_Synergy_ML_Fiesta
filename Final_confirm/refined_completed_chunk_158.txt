The program supports all plant species, emphasizing the importance of selecting adequate hosts such as Nimbus and Mosambi, which are excellent for planting. Unlike traditional methods that require wood, this approach focuses on planting roots directly into the soil without deforestation. The optimal height for starting open grazing is between 5-6 feet after 3 years, which is when farmers can begin to graze their animals. Permissions for treeplanting can be obtained from the forest department at a cost of 3 rupees per acre; however, natural seeds sourced from forests are recommended instead of purchasing from nurseries. Fast-growing trees yield higher oil content but should not be restricted to cultured varieties; natural ones are equally beneficial and more economical. Initial investment saved by using cheaper natural seeds rather than expensive nursery trees can fund other aspects of life while contributing to climate change mitigation and biodiversity preservation. Contact with saplings for monetary gain is discouraged in favor of fostering growth through trustworthy local governmental nurseries like those in Chintamani and Srinivasapura within Kolar district, backed by permissions provided by forest departments upon request. This initiative aims to encourage mass tree planting towards environmental sustainability and collective well-being.
