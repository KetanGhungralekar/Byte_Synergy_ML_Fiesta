Mr. Shrikhande emphasized the importance of having a clear plan when building a project, particularly regarding Srikandha's development. Srikandha is categorized as a medium-sized project, distinct from an MRA (Medium Residential Area), which requires careful consideration in its design and construction to ensure it meets specific dimensions— ideally within the range of 75 to 80 feet in width but not exceeding MRA size constraints. The budget for this project must be managed diligently, with expenditures expected to fall below INR 3 lakhs. A notable aspect is that the company has already invested in acquiring suitable land for this venture and owns an ERT machine necessary for testing wood samples as part of their secondary metabolism process. This equipment is relatively affordable under INR 3 lakhs and serves as a core component in their operations alongside producing medicines and aromatic products related to health care and cosmetics markets, Moreover, the company offers services involving the ERT machine at minimal rates without disclosing sensitive information—a detail that was questioned by an attendee who brought up concerns about transparency regarding government initiatives intended for free land distribution aimed at supporting farmers like those hailing from Vijayapura seeking access to such resources while navigating various advantages and challenges presented by these opportunities outside established agricultural lands or 'white fields'.
