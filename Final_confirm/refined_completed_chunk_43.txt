The plant in question, which emits a distinct odor, is found in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand and grows particularly well in Kempumishrita and Lomi soils across various lands. The Indian government facilitates the cultivation of this plant by providing farmers INR 30 per month without any need for application or permission. There is significant market demand for this crop which includes requests from all over Karnataka for items like rice, dalambi (pulses), and mao (beans). The plant can be harvested annually if grown with adequate sunlight requirements due to its light demands. Introduction of leguminous plants such as dalbarji (pigeon pea) and rosewood trees alongside this crop is recommended to enhance soil fertility. Farmers who adopted this plant started last year and expect it to mature within more than eight months are likely to see substantial benefits from both the public and private markets, where it could fetch upwards of INR 120,000 per tree based on current estimates in the private sector. Additionally, scientific interventions have been successful in improving wood formation without adverse effects reported thus far.
