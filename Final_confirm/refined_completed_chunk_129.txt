After waking up to financial requests from family members, the narrator discovered that everyone's phones were out of service due to anticipatory excitement over future victories. Despite their pleas for money, the narrator—who was grappling with depression and a sense of hopelessness after failing to sustain a large-scale farm exceeding 100 acres—found themselves inundated with demands. This prompted introspection about past choices and led to a renewed focus on sustainable agriculture through integration of practices like crop rotation (Rithu Aadharitha Bela Paddhati), covering soil instead of exposing it directly under harsh weather conditions, and adopting various species including Atthu Guntai Bela across 48 acres. The narrator also took inspiration from traditional agricultural systems found within Sadhan Keri and sought guidance from Shri Gandhada Bela advocates at IWST Indian Wood Science Technology despite skepticism about its feasibility in extreme temperatures. Through these methods, the individual successfully cultivated diverse crops such as 2500 Shri Gandhada trees along with other variations during that particular year, thereby creating an environment that nurtures innovation among farmers throughout each seasonal cycle.
