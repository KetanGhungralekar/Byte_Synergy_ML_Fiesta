Srikanda, a valuable fragrant tree known for its essential oil and heartwood, is multispecies parasitic in nature and requires a suitable host to thrive. It typically costs between 10 to 15 thousand rupees based on its quality and size; at 5 feet tall, it has a decent height but needs optimal conditions to flourish. The ideal host for Srikanda include agroforest trees like Malabari (most preferred), Aranya Kurshi, Hebbe, Teak (Honne), and other leguminous plants that provide both nutrients and shade. These hosts must be selected carefullyâ€”they should not overshadow the young Srikanda sapling or inhibit its ability to produce heartwood due to excessive water supply from overly lush hosts. Planting arrangements with appropriate spacing are crucial; primary hosting lasts approximately 6 months to 2 years before transitioning to permanent hosting with larger trees such as teak or honey enriched soils supplemented by Glyrisidia or Sashbeniya which enhance soil fertility further promoting healthy growth of the parasitic Srikanda plant. Proper selection of the primary and secondary hosts impacts the vigor of younger stages until full maturity allows for using larger permanent host species ensuring high-quality production of aromatic oils from matured specimens in hotter climates conducive for their development.
