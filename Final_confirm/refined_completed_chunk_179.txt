İm Hishwarappa, a farmer from ọnSalar, shares his experience of cultivating on approximately 8-10 acres of land. He received this land after obtaining permission from the local government about a year and half ago, during November and December. His farming operation is not entirely complete; it's been operational for one year with some ongoing processes. Initially, he started with 2 acres of land but expanded to 3 due to favorable results which encouraged him to acquire additional land. The crops are supported by irrigation via an in-line drip system that requires watering every other day, minimizing waste.
Hishwarappa reports mixed success; while most plants have thrived, some support plants have weakened and were removed as per advice from agronomists who suggested they would be backed up if needed. Overall, the quality of produce is known post-drying and there are significant advantages in drying agricultural products before sale – enabling immediate purchase by others who offer prompt payment. This process also allows private entities investment opportunities into agriculture similar to what Rajnath Sen represented as President in their contextual parliamentary discussion (comparative reference). Hishwarappa appeals for environmental conservation efforts through sustainable farming practices and acknowledges the potential future prosperity can afford the farmers more freedom to engage in such environmentally friendly approaches benefiting both birds and ecosystem health—a testament to his commitment towards eco-consciousness even amidst financial considerations (thank you noted).
