5 years ago, the Shrikatsa temple began cultivating rare trees such as Srikandai savalambi and paravalambi along with a LAKKATRIRIGA tree known as chogisheethri. Initially growing independently, these trees eventually required supports due to their size. Additionally, other species like manuthuram, Juna, chennai, and old trees were included in the grove but had not grown during earlier times when conditions were less favorable for hardier varieties. Approximately 16 years after commencement of this initiative at an initial 5-acre plot named Setain Choudhary Saw Mill Land Grant (Setain), there has been significant growth observed more recently over the past 3 years with new practices implemented in farming methods leading to positive changes. The current situation in Chandan indicates growth after adopting sustainable agricultural techniques compared to previous decades where little progress was made despite efforts by individuals who previously engaged in dishwashing activities as part of their routine responsibilities on the land since its acquisition three years prior without any discernible outcomes initially.
