3 years ago, the construction of a major dam began on approximately 10 acres of land at a cost of INR 3.7 crores (INR 2 lakh for initial construction plus an additional INR 40 million over three years). The project involved building up to two Srikandha Gidhas within the dam due to color phobia among certain individuals. Despite these challenges and with concerns about potential interference from trucks numbering around 100-50 below the structure, the team successfully protected their work using advanced CCTV surveillance with cameras covering nearly half a kilometer lengthwise along both sides of the dam.
The initiative was driven by community interest in Uddespur when they were granted access to build on fertile land initially intended for agricultural purposes. Initially hesitant because no previous large water structures had been constructed locally, the team took up this challenge after receiving guidance from experts who assessed its viability over a decade-long period before deciding that it could be completed in either 16, 20, or potentially even more extended timelines without necessitating relocation or replacement parts such as coconut trees named 'Saganigopara.'

The project did not face significant issues during execution except for concerns related to safety measures against truck movements near sensitive areas like electricity lines that power pumps critical for maintaining water levels throughout different seasons affecting crop yields accordingly so everything else went smoothly under continuous supervision post completion ensuring longevity beyond just immediate usage but also serving future generations.
