The paragraph discusses the importance of using rocks that are less than 20 years old for a specific purpose, referred to as a Jeda, which is associated with Adhyayana. There are 100 species of Jeda, commonly known as Bale, and these serve as natural pest control, specifically targeting insects rather than beneficial trees and fruits. The Pre-Diater approach mentioned is a biological control method under the concept of Jai Vika Niyantana, which aims to protect trees without using chemicals or manual labor. The key points include the promotion of submerging tree roots to prevent infestation by spiders and other pests; the use of vacuum cleaners for maintaining hygiene; and emphasizing simplicity in problem-solving to avoid complexities like divorce within families. The speaker advocates for considering nature's selection (like water) over artificial methods and suggests creating charts for planning plantations effectively when such plans are absent. This holistic approach seeks to maintain ecological balance while addressing family issues through simple solutions instead of resorting to divisive measures like divorce.
