 The Indian government's National Aayesh Mission, now legalized, aims to support farmers by allowing them to plant Sri Gandha trees on their own land. This initiative has been crucial for farmers facing financial distress and the risk of suicide due to economic challenges. Over the past three years, Sri Gandha forests have expanded by 40 hectares annually, with over 120,000 hectares planted since inception. The program not only promotes reforestation but also diversifies crops through intercropping strategies like maval, cb, sapota alongside traditional monoculture crops such as tomatoes and potatoes. Farmers are encouraged to procure seedlings from authorized forest department centers like Hulimawal or registered sources online. After registration on platforms like FruitsandHaseeru and obtaining a work order from the department responsible for this scheme, farmers receive subsidies via RTGS upon application featuring straightforward procedures ensuring simplicity similar to other agricultural programs in India. Additionally, Sri Gandha has shown promise in mitigating issues with pests and diseases that often affect crop yields thereby enhancing farmer resilience against climate change impacts which threaten food security across various parts of rural India where agriculture remains a primary source of livelihood for millions who depend on sustainable practices provided under initiatives like NFAM/National Ayush Mission (NMM) aimed at augmenting biodiversity while providing alternative income streams beyond conventional farming activities previously restricted exclusively towards proteome cultivation such as common pulses; maize; barley etc., complemented now by diverse options supplied courtesy these supportive state measures coupled with private investments fostering innovation within local agroecosystems promoting ecological balance & social welfare aligned closely together without displacing any existing use rights established earlier especially concerning water resources essential for sustaining life during times when natural disasters strike hardest impacting people most vulnerable among us today--our dedicated farmhands striving tirelessly making sure we all have access tomorrow not just today!
