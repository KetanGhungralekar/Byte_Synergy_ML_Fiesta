 The speaker is demonstrating the critical impact of hosts and light on the growth of Srikant, an 8-year-old plant. They highlight a comparison between two structures: one with a host (hostel) and natural conditions, and another without artificial support but exposed to direct sunlight. The first structure, which lacks proper sunlight due to surrounding walls over 6 feet tall, has limited vertical growth despite reaching 10 feet in height within a year. In contrast, the second structure, essentially a "light-demanding" house sans shading from above or thick walls (only single), shows significantly better growth rates—reaching about 20 feet after one year—because it competes for sunlight avidly. The optimal ratio of valuable heartwood is approximately 30% at the top compared to less than 70% in lower sections of similar species like Mahogany. Despite these findings being evident across hundreds of bamboo plants spread over an acre of land used as gardens by local children who are encouraged to visit for accurate learning experiences about agriculture, some individuals continue to disseminate misinformation leading farmers astray without financial gain for themselves. Their ultimate goal remains to promote quality practices that benefit farmers effectively through sharing insights such as using good sashi poles sourced seasonally rather than relying solely on mahogany due its inferior performance relative to srikand varieties when cultivated correctly under full sun exposure
