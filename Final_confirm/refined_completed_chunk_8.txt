The paragraph describes a scenario where a family has been consuming a certain substance that is described as fresh and appealing. After several days of consumption, one individual begins experiencing stomach discomfort, which they attribute to the ingestion of this substance. It is later revealed that this person had been mistakenly using Methomil (an antiparasitic agent) instead of the intended medication for 90 days due to misinformation from an unnamed source who instructed them to continuously spray chemicals on plants despite knowing about their prolonged use of Methomil.

The person succumbed to their illness shortly after, leaving behind questions about accountability and confusion regarding whether the correct measures were taken during harvesting.
