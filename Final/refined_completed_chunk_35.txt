In the initial years of a project in a single agricultural base within South Karnataka, adequate water availability is crucial, particularly for regions with good natural moisture levels and optimal sunlight exposure on the western border. While irrigation through drip systems isn't typically used in this area, relying solely on natural rainfall can be unpredictable. The growth rate and quality of hardwood vary significantly across different parts of the locationâ€”ranging from poor to high density over 15-20 years. Initial harvests yield around 1-2 kilograms of art wood at an affordable price point; however, after three decades, weights could increase up to 4-5 kilograms or even reach double digits as trees mature and sequester more carbon. It has been observed that frequent heavy watering results in lighter hardwood due to reduced density over time. For sustainable practices without excessive water use, this balance needs to be carefully managed until reaching maturity for potential harvesting around age 30.

Hanum Reddy from Kopala raised concerns about the feasibility of cultivating plants exclusively using forest rains versus artificial methods like drip irrigation far away lands have considered as alternative birthplaces for new projects amidst these discussions regarding cultivation techniques near forests versus distant locations where such conditions may not be available. There remains debate on whether it would be possible or advisable to initiate plant life directly within remote forest ecosystems based on these considerations.
