Srikandha, a sandalwood tree of great significance in India, has been preserved since 2020. By taking its imprint back then and later grafting the name 'Srikandha' onto it, researchers have maintained this precious specimen for over 16 years. The tree is under the care of the forest department, which regulates access to ensure conservation efforts are effective. Sirkandha is not just any tree; it's revered as an ashram associated with divine beings and holds cultural importance within Indian communities.

The sandalwood species (Santalum album) is endemic to India and possesses significant economic value due to its medicinal properties and coveted scent that stands out against other fragrances, often described as Naigandha—the opposite of all others. The oil extracted from Srikandhas contains high concentrations of alpha and beta sandalwood oils, making up more than 90% of their composition—a quality vital for both traditional uses in Hindu rituals and modern applications in medicine and perfumery worldwide. This makes Indian sandalwood one of the most valued across global markets for its unique qualities unmatched by any other variety globally.
