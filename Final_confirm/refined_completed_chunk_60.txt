Vala Mani, a village known for its agricultural activities, faces significant challenges despite having a notable presence on social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook. A single tractor costs between 800 to 900 rupees, yet the financial situation in the village is dire. The cost of Donkeys ranges from 500 to 170 days depending on the source cited but generally falls around 300 rupees each. Farmers are concerned with their end-of-year finances as this determines their "new year." After accounting for expenditures against earningsâ€”which include wages, expenses for agriculture, food, medicine, etc., many farmers find themselves operating at a loss due to an imbalance between cultivation costs and income generated through farming. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal of doubling farmer income by 2022 remains aspirational given that current farm earnings are negligible; thus, any multiplication yields zero net gain financially.
The land itself appears depleted with issues like erosion being reported during harvesting periods. To address these concerns and move towards sustainability and prosperity, there is a call for innovative solutions such as Grow Forestry which could help diversify economic activities beyond conventional farming practices while providing ecological benefits under Minimum Support Price (MSP) guidelines considered by various stakeholders including governments and local communities who weigh all aspects contributing to rural livelihoods comprehensively.
