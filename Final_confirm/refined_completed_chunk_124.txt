Pavitra Jain introduces a young farmer named Hari Yadav, who has embarked on an agricultural journey at the age of 22. With 18 acres of land, Hari has cultivated corn on approximately half of itâ€”specifically 10 out of those 18 acres. He resides with his family consisting of five members: himself, his brother, father, and mother. Despite managing household responsibilities alongside farming duties, Hari started pursuing information technology (IT) education but found his passion in agriculture due to its inherent freedom and opportunity for growth. Inspired by the 'freedom app,' which he discovered as a child and subscribed to after receiving a three-year premium subscription luckily during exams while studying for his second PC course post-IT completion, Hari actively engages with online agri courses provided by platforms like "Sree Gandha" and Dalimbe." His favorite course so far is on dragon fruit cultivation; he credits observing elders engage in agriculture since childhood as giving him preliminary knowledge that complements what he learns from these modern educational resources. Currently focused on planting seeds properly for future yield based upon expert advice received through such programs--aiming to empower students or aspiring farmers like himself through practical application of learned skills directly on their farmlands.
