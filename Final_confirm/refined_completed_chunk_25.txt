3 years ago, a significant construction project began with the initiation of a dam's construction costing approximately ₹3.4 crores over 10 acres of land. The project faced initial skepticism due to its isolated location and potential inefficiency concerns, but it has since proven successful. Despite fears related to color superstitions and challenges like Srikandha Gidhas, which are natural water flow features within the dam structure that were addressed on 10 acres of terrain using innovative strategies such as CC cameras with advanced technology covering distances up to 1000 km for monitoring.
The dam has been operational for three years without encountering any major issues or requiring additional funds beyond the initial investment; its total expenditure stands at around ₹3.74 crores (including an extra allocated amount of ₹40 lakhs). There was no need for coconuts from Saganigobara or any other source during the construction process, as indicated by Uddaspur residents who have shown interest in maintaining and utilizing the facility further. With ongoing maintenance planned for another decade, future decisions regarding expansion or modifications can be considered based on various timelines ranging from 16 to potentially up to 35 years post-construction completion date, although there are currently no plans to dismantle or move the existing infrastructure unless absolutely necessary due to technological advancements rendering it obsolete before then. Meanwhile, locals continue their daily routines uneventfully near this substantial engineering achievement that facilitates sustainable water management practices locally known as "Sari" from Srinaagar's region completed successfully under these unique circumstances involving cultural beliefs and geographical constraints related closely with environmental protection measures taken into account throughout its development phase thus far .
