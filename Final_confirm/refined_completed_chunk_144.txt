Based on the provided paragraph, it appears to describe a variety of exotic fruits grown in Bisl Nand, where conditions are favorable for their cultivation. These include natural red-colored crops used both in pharmaceuticals and food industries, known locally as Sindhu. The fruits are not only suitable for small farms or markets but also fetch good prices due to their quality and demand. There's a call for local farmers to establish their own markets rather than rely solely on larger entities like Reliance because current farming practices prioritize land preservation over intensive agriculture. Some difficulties faced by farmers include limited formal education, which hinders market setup and business management capabilities.
One particular fruit discussed is starfruit (also known as carambola), which is already ripe at harvest time and abundant in vitamin C; it can be consumed fresh without any health concerns if eaten directly from the tree or obtained from trusted sources that employ air-layering methods without chemicals during cultivation explicitly stated to avoid chemical use entirely. The discussion also touches upon other varieties such as golden citaphal, lemon varieties including Thai lemons with distinctive qualities like being sun-dried and scenting nicely, along with various types of orange fruits present in abundance therein labeled "golden citaphal." The emphasis throughout the conversation seems to be on promoting sustainable practices while highlighting the nutritional benefits of these tropical fruits through direct consumption among those who farm themâ€”maintaining an emphasis on health rather than dependency on medical intervention even for farmers themselves who have access to these nutrition-rich foods right within their landscape owing mostly likely due its high content of Vitamin C - This summary captures key points: variety production success, economic potential through markets set up by locals instead of relying on large corporations like Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), challenges faced by farmers including lack of formal education necessary for managing submarkets/standalone businesses successfully!
