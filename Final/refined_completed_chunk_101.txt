In Munnur, a region synonymous with sandalwood and its native species, a conservationist recounts the story of restoring the indigenous sandalwood forests through natural regeneration facilitated by bird dispersal. The process involves spreading soil rich in Srikandha seeds dropped by birds from burst droppings of fruit bats (Aki). This method has led to the growth of over 1000 saplings in an area previously devoid of vegetation. The area is particularly significant as it includes ancient Nandu trees that are crucial for traditional practices such as Sravadara rituals. The conservation efforts also involve educating visitors about sustainable habitat creation against challenges like human interference and environmental degradation caused by dam construction elsewhere, which can disrupt ecosystems and seem oblivious to local ecological knowledge or needs. Despite technological setbacks like unavailable Earthen Tunnel Rat (ETR) machines for digging trenches around young saplings to protect them from grazing animals, these initiatives demonstrate how effective ecological restoration can be when informed by understanding nature's processes and respecting local wisdom.
