Amrut oil, a product from Nalarbet, Gulbarga district, is gaining significant market presence across states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra due to its high demand. The brand prides itself on not using any chemicals; instead, it incorporates beneficial microbes such as Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, PSB (Proteobacteria), Vyam (a local probiotic culture), Bacillus species, and Silica into its products. This approach ensures the oil is 100% organic.

The manufacturing process involves cultivating about 250-300 varieties of plants which include sub-varieties like Bodoli cashew nuts specifically grafted for disease resistance and better yield. These are nurtured without chemical fertilizers or pesticides in the potting mixture that also contains the same beneficiary microbes.

Amrut oil's success story began with the founder's father who engaged in papaya farming but later expanded their offerings to over 74 hectares of land dedicated to Cashew trees under various varietals after facing opposition initially when starting out in farming practices focused on sustainability and natural methods over two generations ago. Their commitment to organic agriculture has led them to initiate a 3-4 year forestation project aimed at preserving biodiversity while maintaining production levels of quality goods like Sindhu Natural Red Color used both domestically as well as industrially for food coloring purposes
