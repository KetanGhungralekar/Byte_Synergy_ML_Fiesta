Summary: During a discussion on planning and execution, it was clarified that Srikhande Infrastructure is not responsible for the size of the land acquired; rather, the land's dimensions were determined before their involvement. The size in question is medium, distinct from an MRA (Medium Residential Area), which had been previously misconstrued. The actual dimension specifications are 75 feet by 80 feet or similar variations within a acceptable range under 3 lakhs INR. Despite initial concerns about budget constraints and the necessity of obtaining approval from Gurugram authorities, it was confirmed that the project fits within financial expectations.
The company has registered itself to handle cosmetics production along with medicine and aromatic products markets as well as providing services related to ERT machines at reasonable rates without compromising on quality control or thorough testing procedures. These operations fall under 'Gandha Medicine & Aromatic,' operated by Pai Herbal Ltd., ensuring a sustainable business model using secondary metabolism principles derived from timber resources for multiple years to come. Additionally, there was a query regarding government policies favoring farmers who access free land, with discussions touching upon potential benefits and drawbacks associated with such moves for those originating from Vijayapura or local areas alike. It should be noted that Srikhande Market is separate from any concept of a free market system being discussed currently in agricultural contexts.
