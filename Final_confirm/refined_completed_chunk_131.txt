The practice of printing water with the word "Srikandha" in it dates back to 2020 and has been continuously presented to the government for over 16 years as part of efforts to protect and manage sandalwood forests. Srikandha, also revered as the Ashram of the Lord, is a semi-root parasitic plant known for its unique properties. Sandalwood, an endemic species vital to India's forest ecosystems, holds immense cultural significance especially during special occasions where its distinctive scent is highly valued. Known colloquially as Naigandha or Champaka, Indian sandalwood is celebrated worldwide for its high qualityâ€”with species like Srikandha being particularly esteemed due to their medicinal and aromatic qualities surpassing those found in other varieties globally. The Indian sandalwood is not only significant within the country but also recognized internationally; it accounts for approximately 90% of global alpha and beta sandal wood production (Champa), underlining its importance both economically and culturally on a global scale.
