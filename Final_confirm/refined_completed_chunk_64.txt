The paragraph discusses the process of selecting and planting seeds for tree cultivation, with a focus on the timely harvesting of mature blooms rather than waiting 22 years as was traditionally done. The old forest system emphasized well-planted trees, but contemporary practices involve collecting seeds over 4 to 5 years from trees that have reached reproductive maturity—signified by full bloom. The Oxford Dictionary notes that this is when trees are ready for seed collection. Despite having collected seeds, there has been a lapse of 25 years due to oversight, which has led to a dependency on seed imports from International Wood Sand Den (IWSD). Seeds obtained from IWSD were found in three sizes: small, medium, and large; however, size does not significantly affect growth rate or outcome. Seeds can be harvested twice a year—in April and September/October—and one kilogram of seeds yields approximately 5 to 5.5 thousand saplings with around half successfully germinating after proper treatment in both nurseries and mini-semi environments where insecticides and fungicides may be applied if necessary for optimal results.
