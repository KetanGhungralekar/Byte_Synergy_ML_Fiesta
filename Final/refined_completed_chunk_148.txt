The parishioners have successfully identified the lowest and highest points of their irrigation system, utilizing drip channels aligned with the planting direction. Over the past year, they have been consistently cultivating coriander in this area, achieving significant yields and profits. The coriander plants grown here are robust and mature quickly due to favorable conditions provided by Srikandha's hosting environment—a variety known for its optimal growth characteristics.
Srikandha hosts a garden where nearly all plants exhibit uniform growth; this is attributed to starting with a healthy mother plant from which cuttings or seeds can be propagated for even development. The author emphasizes the importance of proper seed sowing techniques for achieving such consistent results. In terms of pest management, organic methods are used instead of chemical sprays when dealing with diseases like fevamsha, which thrive in moist environments but can be managed through careful water release practices that balance moisture without encouraging excessive fevamsha growth.

Furthermore, the garden produces substantial yields annually—between 1 to 1.5 lakhs (100-500 kilograms) in one collection period and between 2 to 3 lakhs (200-500 kilograms) from just coriander alone each year. These figures highlight not only quantity but also profitability potential for those interested in adopting similar farming practices or visiting this model farm situated near Hidikkal village within Belgaum district for further guidance on setting up their own profitable gardens based on these methods demonstrated in another video planned by them
