Sita Pala discusses his journey from being a farmer struggling with water scarcity to understanding the importance of managing this resource effectively. He emphasizes that in Karnataka, the primary issue is the availability of water, which directly impacts crop yields and specifically increases oil content in crops as water levels decrease. With over a decade of farming experience, Sita Pala has gained insights into hosting management (pest control), nutrition supply, and optimal harvest conditions. His advice to fellow farmers is to prioritize quality water management rather than relying solely on technological solutions like social media platforms for agricultural guidance. He warns against neglecting farm duties and advocates for hands-on approach reminiscent of a "boss" attitude towards one's land. Sita Pala also promotes awareness about agriculture through interviews available at www.kalamadhima.com and shares his expertise by conducting sessions on sustainable farming practices based on practical experiences he has collected throughout his career in Sandalwood cultivation among other ventures across India, notably with recent focus on its expansion in Bangalore where he conducted an exclusive interview exploring various facets of Sandalwood growth and industry trends.
