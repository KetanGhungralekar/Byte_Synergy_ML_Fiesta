The paragraph discusses the evolution of food culture, particularly in villages where a variety of fresh fruits like apples, oranges, and dragon fruits are now available. It emphasizes the importance of preserving nature and biodiversity, including local agricultural practices. The discussion shifts to highlight the value of certain exotic plants and trees such as coconut trees, cactus (used for its show qualities), agarwood (which is used to make incense called agarbathi), and various types of sandalwood (red sandalwood/sandaline). The latter is described as extremely costly; for instance, 100 tonnes can range from 80 lakhs to 1 crore 20 lakhs INR with ore than 90% natural components like santalol, santalin A & B. Sandalenic acid must comprise at least 30-40% oil content for it to be considered high quality. These products have seen rising prices globally due to their chemical composition which includes valuable elements like Santalonea fragrans extract beta pinene among others that cannot be readily found elsewhere in significant quantities. The passage concludes by providing some insights into sustainable harvesting methods such as cutting side branches by half when cultivating these rare woods for commercial use while acknowledging their significance not just economically but also culturally.
