 After purchasing Sari in Srinagar, understanding the optimal time for cutting it to ensure proper growth is crucial. The seeds used are around 10 years old, sourced from the forests where they were observed and discussed with local foresters. These seeds exhibit a pleasant aroma but some unusual notes as well.

The cost of cultivation varies significantly depending on the location; in Srikanth, approximately Rs.50 to Rs.100,000 is spent per acre for tree felling operations. Despite these costs, the investment pays off substantially over timeâ€”investors can expect earnings of up to Rs.3 crores after 16 years for each acre if managed properly without any additional expenditure beyond annual maintenance fees estimated at about Rs.20 lakh every year unless action is taken to improve water retention which could potentially reduce expenses slightly or necessitate higher payments if not addressed promptly.

It's important to note that these high returns come with considerable financial commitments: an individual must be prepared to pay 2-4 million annually (Rs.20-40 lakhs) herself/himself rather than relying on external assistance such as subsidies or government support typically required by those considered 'demons' who might only afford around Rs.3-4 lakhs per year themselves towards this enterprise without such aid
