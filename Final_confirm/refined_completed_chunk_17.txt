 A community-focused initiative has been undertaken with the primary objective of providing support to impoverished villagers. The project involves extensive efforts to assist these individuals, emphasizing that constructing new houses is not necessary as one has already been provided by their parents on the same day they received a promotion. The program's key aspect is its commitment to empower and uplift the poor through direct financial or material assistance, rather than building infrastructure. This approach aligns with the goal of immediately addressing the immediate needs of these villagers for sustainable improvement in their living conditions.
