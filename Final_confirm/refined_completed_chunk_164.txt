 The paragraph describes a situation where an individual, possibly speaking to authorities or community members, expresses frustration over being unfairly treated by someone who received money for building a house but failed to grant basic rights such as education and the use of electricity. This person is under constant observation from individuals (referred to as "they") who patrol the area every 12 hours, specifically targeting the location during those times. These observers are described as coming from Nayanalli and carrying out surveillance at night without interrupting machinery operations.
The speaker also points out deficiencies in security measures within Vishwavidyan City, with only five entry points that lack proper checkposts. They highlight the neglect of social responsibility by local home guards, police officers, and university personnel towards protecting society's welfare against illegal activities like unauthorized construction in Anandi forest areas.

Key statistics include:
- 63 home guards in Vishwavidyan City
- Only 5 main entrances into Vishwavidyan City without proper checkpoints
- A significant amount of money (around 17-20 crores) required for purchasing land or property mentioned in context of real estate prices in Karnataka.
There is a mention of "Kshana Kshana Sudhi" which seems to be related to some kind of program or campaign aimed at clarification or reality checks ("sudhi" means purity/clarification), possibly linked to environmental concerns regarding illicit constructions affecting forests and natural habitats despite laws meant to protect them. The speaker advocates for stern action by government officials against corrupt practices causing environmental damage before these structures can be demolished at imminent risk unless addressed properly by responsible authorities.
