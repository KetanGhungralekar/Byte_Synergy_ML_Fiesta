They emphasized that they personally do not perform electrical work or fence installation but manage 800 windbreakers effectively for solar fencing purposes. The use of these windbreakers is crucial in preventing winds from reaching the ground at 18 feet, which would otherwise dry out crops.

These sustainable practices aim for self-reliance without any financial input beyond initial setup costs; specifically mentioning the '6 by 6' approach recommended by Aranya Krishnan himself before demonstrating water conservation techniques and inviting questions on the subject matter presented—all within an effort towards creating high living standards for families through organic farming methods
