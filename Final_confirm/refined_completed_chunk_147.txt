 In this video, the speaker addresses the importance of quality control in harvesting and strongly advises against unnecessary changes. They offer assistance to those unfamiliar with the process or who may have concerns, irrespective of their educational background. The subject at hand involves the responsible harvesting of a 9-year-old hardwood tree whose roots are still intact, which can be preserved if desired.
The location features approximately 2000 trees within a fenced area that has been left open due to its age. Trees were cut down at night under uncertain circumstances, resulting in an odor and requiring immediate action to prevent fungal growth after cutting. The recommended course is to apply Beltox paste thoroughly on the freshly cut surfaces to ensure cell development and preserve the Tree's life without compromising its integrity for further use such as carbon sequestration, for which electric fencing provides effective protection against pests and decay while contributing positively to environmental conservation.
