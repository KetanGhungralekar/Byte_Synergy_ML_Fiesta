 The Srigandha route, which is three times larger than its stem, has a significant oil content of 6%, contrasting with other states at 1-2%. Karnataka's focus on sustaining Srigandha is due to its inherent 'God-gifted nature' from Bhoomi Thay and the natural support of Mother Nature. It is crucial to preserve this resource as it may become extinct within seven to eight years if improperly managed. The Srigandha must remain unwatered initially; however, after several years, careful water management will allow for greater water extraction capabilities. Its size is proportional to the retention of side walls and prevention of erosion during monsoons when excess water needs to be drained without losing grass cover. Repeated plowing or interference can lead to soil pollution affecting food quality in Bangalore and Mysore regions. Natural farming practices advocated by proponents firmly oppose smart work relying solely on traditional methods like cow urine/dung (Gau Mutra/Gobar), coconut ash application (Nariyal Ke Nimbu), and manual labor efforts rather than modern irrigation systems or chemical fertilizers. These methods encourage organic waste recycling for mulching purposes back into the market cycle for economic returns while emphasizing minimal interventionâ€”a testament exemplifying sustainable agriculture through direct carbon sequestration reducing pollution risks associated with conventional farming practices elsewhere in India today.
