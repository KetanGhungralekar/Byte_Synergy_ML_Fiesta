The paragraph discusses a specific seed used primarily for medicinal purposes rather than cultivation due to its poor growth rate. The seed is beneficial for individuals with diabetes and other health conditions, and bees are known to consume it as a source of food in the field. Traditionally, the seeds were harvested by pulling them out manually using a tractor and then treated with unspecified chemicals applied by an individual who expresses concerns about potential harm from these substances.
Financial aspects of agricultural work are highlighted, where an individual previously earned 2 lakhs per month but could potentially earn up to 10 lakhs monthly if dedicated and financially invested. However, success is described as requiring both commitment and patienceâ€”it doesn't come quickly like securing a job through campus interviews. The work-life balance in agriculture permits flexibility; one interviewee describes their lifestyle as being able to manage without strict schedules or weekly commitments. They emphasize that while they can take time off when needed (like after children's exams), managing this type of farm requires being involved in various tasks throughout the day, including cooking meals alongside labor activities. Despite challenges such as crop loss and the need for planning at different timelines (long-term vs short-term), farming is portrayed as a serene profession suitable for those seeking simplicity over material wealth or rigid career paths.
